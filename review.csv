11th Street Cafe,4,Wouldn't let me order a coffee while holding my tiny dog.  I live on 11th st 2 blocks from this cafe in an apartment I've owned for 7 years.  That's a first for me In this neighborhood. Most will let you order inside and wait outside. They wouldn't take my order.,1,12/15/2018,1,2,0,40.7357789,-74.00725826
11th Street Cafe,4,"The selection of drinks and smoothies and food is wonderful. They've got something for everyone, including vegetarians and vegans. The staff was friendly too. Only downside was that the manager said they ""no longer offer the free cook deal"" offered here on Yelp. When I showed it to them they said ""yeah...we should probably take that down.""

11th Street Cafe,4,"First time here.  I'll be here again.  What you need to know: *Free wi-fi. *Good coffee. *Cheddar and Egg biscuit with Ham was delicious --- ask for it toasted. *Selection of wines and beer available. *A total of nine tables... each seats 2 people.  So yes, it's tiny. *Was here for two hours and there were always people in line; was almost always about five people deep.  For a tucked-away neighborhood spot, pretty impressive.  No fears though, service was pretty fast.  Only real downer is that there's no restroom.  Think it might be intentional; otherwise people like me would be here all day. :)",1,9/8/2011,1,0,0,40.7357789,-74.00725826
11th Street Cafe,4,"Great place for lunch.  Last time I went I got an absolutely delicious sandwich!  It was a prosciutto, aged asiago, argula and truffle oil sandwich on a baguette.  It was one of the cheaper options on the menu, which is why I went with it.  Service with a smile too!  It's a little small, with only about 6 tables so if you come to eat here, keep in mind that you might not be able to sit.",1,2/8/2012,2,0,1,40.7357789,-74.00725826

Ancolie,4.5,"So disappointed I wasted 10$ on this soup and sandwich special: warm pea soup (only choice) and ham and cheese ( basically tiny white bread w one slice of ham and one slice of cheese . I should have taken a picture in relation to my hand. I would be embarrassed to make a sandwich like that for a guest. This place is not for eating . Coffee might be ok, was too annoyed to stay and experiment further.",1,4/2/2018,1,0,0,40.73324539,-73.99910375
Ancolie,4.5,"So I walked by this place a few times, and I have to say the idea of food in the jar peaked my interest, but millions of people have been putting food in jars and cans since I don't even know how long... At least over 120 years. Then one time I actually went in, perused the menu which was much much higher up in the air than my head, and it looked fine, but nothing special. So I swore that moment right then and there to ask what time it was, turn walk out the door, and never come back again. I might even start a new life, where I get my memory erased and then purposefully avoid, memento post-it-notes style, this restaurant and its location.  That's when Kate started talking about this place ""Ancolie""... ""What the hell was it"" I asked. ""Well, it's incredible place around the corner"" she said. ""They make food and put it in a jar."" ""Great!"" People had been making food in a jar, for, I don't know, years I guess- how would I know, but I trust Kate and so off we went. When I went into the place k8 started raving. They have a quinoa jar and there are layers of delicious..."" Her voice trailed off into the background, sort of fading, whisked away by... Had I... no, I thought, this place just seems so familiar, but something, I'm not sure.  Something not so specia- ""Hey!  Try this!"" ""What is it?"" I thought, it resembled some sort of thick green koolaid... ""Just try it!  It's Matcha Tea with Almond Milk!"" I took a sip- I BLAM remembered feeling like I wanted to know what time it was but didn't care, a flurry of phone calls, a scientist, darknet found, needles and a pair of old grey Adidas shoes good god the pain and BLAM BLAM BLANK BLANK blank blank blank-  ""T.J.?""  ""T.J.?""  ""Yes, sorry I must have, I got dizzy- wow well what is this?!""  ""It's matcha !  With almond milk !""   She exclaimed, often my wife spoke in a hybrid emoji English language she developed with her Japanese friend Tsubee.  ""Wow.  Delicious.""  Yes.  It was. It was the best thing I had ever tasted!  ""Isn't it the best thing you have ever tasted!!??""  I loved it.  It was my favorite thing.  ""Isn't it your favorite thing!""  Kate said.  ""It is,"" I said- ""it is.""  I will give this place a five star review.  ""You gotta give this place a five star review!""  ""I will"" I thought, and I I won't make it too weird.  ""And don't make it too weird!""  ""Yeah Kate, I'll do it right now.. just, can I have another matcha  with almond  ?""  ""Yes bumble bee-- now get those thumbs a movin'!""  And so I did.  Why wouldn't I. I had drank the matcha. We all had.  You will too.  And then you will give them a five star review, because it's the best thing you've ever had and you won't think about time in there or whether things are special or not, you will just drink that drink.  You can eat, relax, whatever you want.  But you will drink that drink.  You will drink the matcha green tea with almond milk.  You will drink the matcha.  -witch docta",1,3/15/2018,0,0,0,40.73324539,-73.99910375
Ancolie,4.5,"So fresh and delicious. You might not think salad will fill you up all the way, but it does. I guess were so used to those big nasty plastic bowls of rancid lettuce from OTHER establishments. Everything here is wonderful. I have not been disappointed yet.

Bean & Bean,4,I work in the building next door so I frequently go in for a Chai latte iced with Oat milk & I always say light ice because for $7 bucks I'm paying for the Latte not ice & I stress this all the time & I still get a cup full of ice. Think I'll go back to Starbucks at least they know how to follow instructions.,1,5/30/2017,0,0,0,40.70730642,-74.01220905
Bean & Bean,4,"This place is like a hidden treasure in financial district. The entrance and the outer look doesn't attract people but inside is amazing. I tried hot matcha latte, it was better than I had before in other coffee shops. It was thick and creamy, just like the way I love it. The place has plenty of space and very clean bathroom too. I spent hours early in the morning and it was worth it. They have unique tastes that I want to try next time I go there. The staff was very nice, but when they give you your coffee they don't put the lid which is both good and bad depends on the people. I didn't care much but was afraid to spill when I try to put the lid on since the cup was brimful.",1,3/20/2017,1,0,0,40.70730642,-74.01220905
Bean & Bean,4,A nice and friendly little coffee shop in New York City!!  I was a little hesitant to try a Chai Tea other than Starbucks but it turns out Bean & Bean's Chai Tea tasted so much better!!!,1,6/4/2015,1,0,0,40.70730642,-74.01220905
Bean & Bean,4,"Free wifi, moderate seating and outlets, baked goods, organic coffee roasted in-house, very friendly staff, slightly expensive for even organic coffee, but it probably contributes to friendly staff and them staying independent--decor similar to Starbucks, but much better in every way. I'm pretty sure their coffee is fair trade, but it seems they care more about their drinks being organic as that's clearly posted everywhere.  I had the honey latte since I'd never heard of that before. I asked about it and was told honey granules are mixed into a latte. It doesn't taste like honey so I'm guessing they offer it simply as a healthier sweetener to lattes. Came here around noon and there was plenty of seating for me to study and do work as a college student in finals season. Not sure what its like at other times during the day/weekends.  Glad I found this through a Yelp search and will be returning whenever I need a cafe at which to do work.",1,12/16/2013,1,0,0,40.70730642,-74.01220905
Bean & Bean,4,"Excellent coffee - strong, dark and deep flavors. Roasting beans in-house goes a long way for wonderful tastes and smell. The coffee is priced very well, but some other items are a bit steep. A pretty straight forward menu with a good mix of specialty products such as the gelati, macarons, and vegan cookies. A seriously busy people-watching, macbook-loving, and cafe-socializing crowd - this place is almost always packed but oddly enough - a seat isn't impossible. The service is average and they could really work on adding just a bit of something as far as personality. Not all employees are knowledgeable about its products and menu, sometimes even outright puzzled at questions and lacking familiarity overall. But all-in-all, never bad service or a bad experience, just a bit slow and subdued at times. Everything is pretty consistent with the original location in downtown Manhattan as far as their product and culture. Just way (way!) more Asian-Americans at this Bayside outpost. An overall excellent addition to the area that looks like is here to stay.",1,2/25/2015,0,0,0,40.70730642,-74.01220905

Bean & Bean,4,It was such a cold day in the city that I stopped in this coffee shop to grab a hot cup of coffee. I was pleasantly surprised that they sold organic coffee and it was better than your typical Starbucks. I had the white chocolate mocha which was just perfect. Just enough sweet and coffee.,1,1/5/2012,2,0,1,40.70730642,-74.01220905
Bean & Bean,4,"It's nice to see the one-cup-at-a-time motif, however small, takling hold here in NY. This independent organic coffee house makes a decent cup of joe, but I would like to see more premium options than the three offered here on a daily basis. 3.25 stars is about right for this place.",1,12/20/2011,0,0,0,40.70730642,-74.01220905
Black Fox Coffee,4,"Stopped in because I was hungry and wanted a quick bite. The few menu items I was interested in unfortunately had pork in them so I could not partake. So sad. Instead, I went with a flat white and a brownie after reading all the great reviews. Yes, I replaced lunch with a brownie. That's what being a grown up is all abou  Service was good and timely. Pretty disappointed with the brownie. Other reviews said it was half rich chocolatey/half cake like. Sadly mine was not. I was so excited too because there was only one left and I got the last one. When I bit into my brownie, I found that it was extremely fudgey and not brownie/cake like at all. The 2 ingredients I tasted most was oil and sugar, not rich chocolate. So. Sad. I didn't finish it and ended up throwing more than half of it away! Yes, I threw chocolate away. A travesty, I know. And I think I paid like $3 for it.. T___T for my flat white and brownie, I paid about $9. Coffee didn't strike me as anything outstanding, and a bit bitter for my tastes. Probably wouldn't return here unless I happen to be walking by and in dire need of caffeine.",1,12/6/2018,3,0,0,40.7065047,-74.0077715
Black Fox Coffee,4,"I rarely give reviews but I just have to say this place is awful. I used to come here a lot for meetings and sometimes for a place to work in between meetings but they have a no computer policy at the tables. Their servers are extremely rude to the point where they raised their voice and yelled at me for having my laptop out for 5 minutes to type out an email.  Their coffee is overpriced and their matcha latte has no matcha in it. At around 2pm it is so crowded, there are no seats. I recommend going elsewhere like La Colombe on Wall St, Joe & the Juice, Hole in The Wall on Cliff, or Blue Stone Lane on water. They all have better service, a better environment, and higher quality options at a much lower price.",1,1/19/2018,2,1,0,40.7065047,-74.0077715
Black Fox Coffee,4,"Came to visit my daughter, who lives in the same bldg, thought I'd sit and have a tea w one of their avocado toast and check my emails. As soon as I pull out my computer, I'm asked to move to a high top table because they were busy and the low tops are for two or more?!? I'm frickin' 65 years old, just wanting to chill, but it was made quite clear they'd rather you not sit and do any work on a computer!! Cancelled my order and left! The place must have good food/coffee, because it was busy, but certainly not kind to the elderly!",1,2/23/2019,0,0,0,40.7065047,-74.0077715
Black Fox Coffee,4,"Stepping inside Black Fox on a busy work morning or during an afternoon break immediately makes me feel calmer. The ambiance is beautiful and the music is perfect for relaxing or getting some work done.  The coffee? Amazing. Everything from cold brew, drip coffee (Americano), and espresso beverages (cappuccino) are extremely high quality.  They serve some good looking pastries and Underwest doughnuts. I also tried a slice of the Spanish tortilla, which was pricey but delicious.  The service is awesome too. The staff is super friendly and if you decide to stay your coffee is brought to you with sleek presentation.  I think this is one of the best coffee shops in FiDi!",1,6/13/2018,0,0,0,40.7065047,-74.0077715
Black Fox Coffee,4,"Soy chai is good but apparently medical service animals are not welcome here so if you have a disability or disabling medical condition requiring you to have a service animal, best to go elsewhere.  Shout out to the barista who made me feel like my disability was a huge inconvenience for them. Didn't even get to finish my second drink because I just felt unwelcome and wanted to leave after that. Good times.  UPDATE in response to Daniel: Wow thanks so much for explaining all that! Lol. The thing is my dog is a seizure dog, he detects impending seizures for my safety. As such he is a service dog and NOT an emotional support animal. I tried explaining that to you in person when you kicked me out, but you were too busy telling me about all your years of experience in the food industry and how you know the laws regarding service animals. Whatever, man...I just really don't have the patience to deal with ppl like you.  Also, Cafe Grumpy has way better chai lattes than you guys.",1,6/11/2018,2,2,1,40.7065047,-74.0077715
Black Fox Coffee,4,"This coffee shop is right under my hotel so I had to check it out. I think it's an Australian shop - great coffee, smoothies and breakfast. I love the avocado toast. The egg and sausage sandwich - the sausage is pretty spicy and not what I was expecting to eat first thing in the morning but delicious. The almond milk latte was delicious and had a hint of sweetness. They are busy at all hours of the day but I didn't have to wait long for my coffee.",1,2/1/2018,0,0,0,40.7065047,-74.0077715
Black Fox Coffee,4,"Stumbled on this place the other day and was definitely not disappointed! Such a nice cozy vibe, love the interesting coffee selection! It is definitely a breath of fresh air from the other coffee shops in Lower Manhattan.  Was catching up with friends and we were going to go somewhere else, but all the tables were used by people working on laptops.  I like that Black Fox seems to have a no laptop policy, it totally kills the vibe when everyone is sitting taking up tables working with headphones on -  cafes aren't meant to feel like public libraries! Also love that it is pretty close by to the East River ferry so it is easy to get to from Williamsburg! Will definitely be back soon :)",1,2/27/2019,0,0,0,40.7065047,-74.0077715
Black Fox Coffee,4,"A new cozy and local coffee shop in FiDi! It is a love-at-first-sight/sip coffee place for me. The high ceiling, big space, wood interior, and big windows are nice pluses! Barista warmly welcomes you upon entrance. I got an almond flat white to-go (although I would really love to hang out and spend more time here!). I appreciate the fact that baristas spend time making you a nice latte art even though you ordered it to-go! One sip, I can taste passion in it! it is very fruity (citrus taste?), rich, foamy with nice chocolaty/nutty aroma. That was not it... The after taste is sweet, which is similar to how good teas make you feel sweet but not thirsty in the end.  Highly recommend this nice coffee shop for coffee lovers/meeting/friends gathering. Bakeries and sandwiches also look delicious. I just wish they open on weekends!",1,3/11/2018,1,0,1,40.7065047,-74.0077715
Black Fox Coffee,4,"This Aussie cafe opened one block from my apt back in last year and quickly became the hot spot for Wall Streeters as well as people living in the hood.  The space is modern and welcoming. Perfect to catch up with friend or just take a coffee break . They have oat milk and almond milk in addition to cows milk. Only wish they got soy as well :/  They made damn good latte :) $6 a pop , expensive but worth the splurge once in a while .",1,1/20/2019,0,0,0,40.7065047,-74.0077715
Black Fox Coffee,4,"Espresso was fantastic! Breakfast was good, but honestly a little overpriced. Overall I think the place has the potential to be great, but the woman taking orders was very unpleasant, and ripe with attitude. I'm not sure if it was a race thing, or a sexist thing, but either way she did not like me, and I'm a wonderfully pleasant person. I will not be returning to this establishment, which is a shame, because their espresso really was fantastic.",1,9/3/2018,0,0,0,40.7065047,-74.0077715
Black Fox Coffee,4,"I have been waiting to try black fox for almost a year, it was simply too far away from me! So today I'm more than happy to run here and eventually got a taste of their famous flat white.  Probably due to the fact that I was sitting inside rather than grabbing to go, my coffee was really foamy and the latte art well-drawn. The balance was also quite right, that I first discovered a bit of bitterness while left with sweetness afterwards. This special combination completely took charge of my tastebuds and I was left fully convinced. Loved each single sip of it!  I would have to make sure that I come back sometime future, just to have a difference experience of their latte, or even espresso. In my opinion, a good coffee shop simply brews coffee; while an outstanding one tries to attach their coffee with emotion. Black fox certainly belongs to the latter and I hope to see more of it!  Don't miss this hidden gem if you happen to be in this neighborhood.",1,10/15/2016,14,9,8,40.7065047,-74.0077715
Black Fox Coffee,4,"Cute but expensive cafe in the Wall Street area. Several pastry options are available and the beverage options are rather comprehensive. Seating is also plentiful, and I was a fan of the chill atmosphere. However, not sure if I would come back if I'm getting things to go.",1,6/29/2017,4,2,3,40.7065047,-74.0077715
Black Fox Coffee,4,"The ambience here is lovely, especially when you go in early in the morning before they get crowded with fashionistas and people in suits taking meetings and using laptops, which are limited to counter space so tables can be used for friends and people getting food. The food is great. Really kind of simple and savory. Rotating espressos and multiple espresso options! The filter coffee is probably their most stand out element though, nothing quite like getting a little pot to stay and sip from a little white-glazed ceramic cup. It's a great little cafe, hidden away down one narrow old street in the financial district.",1,4/1/2018,0,0,0,40.7065047,-74.0077715

Black Fox Coffee,4,"tl;dr: awesome espresso, gorgeous place, very overpriced.  Food/coffee: This place seems to be Aussie owned/run, which explains the awesome espresso. I usually eat a flat white or a cortado, and they're both worthy of 5 stars. Delicious and pretty. I've had a muffin (fine, nothing special) and the smashed avo toast with a poached egg, which is REALLY good but like $11.  Space: beautiful coffee shop with high windows, a good amount of seating, mix of bar seats, communal tables, and small tables. A good place to go alone - they have newspapers and magazines and wifi, and you can face out at the window and people watch.  I took one star off just for pricing - I'd go here every day if not for that!",1,8/11/2016,0,0,0,40.7065047,-74.0077715
Black Fox Coffee,4,"REVISED REVIEW Originally I gave this place 1-STAR for the snooty staff and overall pretentious vibe but have recently returned and believe they deserve an increase in stars!  Much better selection of food, although cost is very high (for example: $9.5 for avocado toast?!) even for fresh and made-to-order quality. I think the lunch options look delicious and hopefully warrant the purchase, if anything just to treat myself one time.  I'm a latte drinker so I can't comment on the specific tastes of the coffee, although I am aware they often offer unique beans and roasts often hard to find and very are limited to region and seasonal availability. I enjoy the fact that they have an espresso and coffee offering menu for your choosing despite I don't always understand how that translates into the taste. What ends up happening is that I order a latte but don't know which espresso for it to pull from. The staff should be a bit more receptive of this and eager to offer their suggestion.  Their latte was right on point in terms of taste, temperature and texture. Kudos for the added latte art!",1,8/2/2016,1,1,0,40.7065047,-74.0077715

Black Fox Coffee,4,"Service: The people who work here are really friendly - you can tell they care about their jobs! The line moves quickly (even if it looks long) and I've never had to wait more than 2-3 minutes for my drink. Ambiance: Its a pretty large space, especially compared to other coffee shops nearby. I've never done work here, but there is definitely enough room to find a table and stay for a while (they have ""for here"" mugs for this purpose). It would be a good place to meet a friend for coffee. Coffee: *I've only ever had their iced latte* - the iced latte was amazing! Not bitter at all. Price: A bit pricey, but nothing crazy for the area. Definitely worth it if you care about the quality of your coffee. Food: I haven't tried it yet - but they have a variety of options. There are a few items that would be enough for a full lunch.",1,12/7/2016,2,1,0,40.7065047,-74.0077715
Black Fox Coffee,4,"Expensive but worth it - never knew iced coffee could taste so good before black fox. Their almond croissants are to die for.

Brooklyn Diamond Coffee,4,"I don't usually write reviews, but my experience here was so bad that I was compelled to. Terrible matcha lattes that have no matcha powder at all. I paid $5 for lukewarm milk foam with sprinkles of matcha on top. My drink was made in less than 30 seconds, which was the quickest, most half-assed job I've ever seen.  The guy at the counter was incredibly rude and condescending (also came across racist, I am Asian-American) when I asked if they had the matcha cronuts I saw on this Yelp page.  Me: ""Do you happen to have the matcha cronuts today?"" Him: ""I don't know what those are. Are they American?"" Me: ""I saw photos of them on your Yelp page."" Him: ""I've never seen them before and I've been here for a year and a half.""  Maybe he should do some research on his own place of employment to get an understanding of his job and general feedback??? I am also 150% certain that a young guy like him living in NYC knows what ""matcha"" means, and what a ""cronut"" is. More importantly, there is no reason to be rude to customers. Completely unacceptable. I will definitely not be returning, and will not recommend this place to anyone.

By the Way Bakery,4.5,"I don't write reviews often, but when it comes to service I am a bit of a stickler. I left knowing they did not value my time or my patronship, which is really a bummer because their baked goods looked delicious.  Hoping to get my friend a gluten-free dairy-free cake for her birthday party, I called a day before and was informed they cannot make orders less than 48 hours in advance. Completely understandable. But! - they say- come in tomorrow and we make cakes for purchase. They go pretty quickly and it is a first come first serve, so you might want to get here early. We open at 8.  ""Great! hopefully I will be able to grab one"" I said. ""hopefully."" she replies.  Fine. So I get up extra early so I can get there before work, go all the way uptown, wait in line for them to open, and hope, as one of the first people, I can get one of the amazing looking cakes! I overhear the very sweet woman in front of me asking for a cake as well. She had come in nice and early to grab a cake also for a party- someone in the same boat as me. The lady behind the counter says: Sorry! We don't sell cakes right now, we are still putting away orders and cant sell any cakes at this time.... The other woman, rightfully, says then why did you tell me to come in at this hour to buy one? I wish you would have told me that. I chime in to verify: sooo no cakes right now? Even though you told this nice woman and myself to come to your place of business at the time you open to buy one of your stupid cakes? ""no"" she says ""We can't put any cakes on hold either... but maybe come back in a couple hours? Probably 2 hours or so"". ok well I have a job and I'm certainly not coming back here again because chances are in 2 hours your not going to have any cakes to sell me. The other customer and I are severely disappointed to say the least.  It's the poor attitude and absolute disregard for this woman's and my time and efforts that bother me. Even if they had made a mistake and tried to still help us, anyone can understand that. But they offer us no other solutions or any recourse for giving us their false and misleading information except for a half-hearted sorry and then asking ""sooo what can I get you?"". Nothing.

I tried a piece of their banana nut muffin when I voluntarily had my wife shove a piece down my throat and I couldn't believe it was gluten free! It was so moist and delicious that I wanted to rip away the rest from my wife and eat it all in one bite, but then I remembered I live with this woman so I just watched her finish the muffin with my jealous eyes.

The 4 of us decided that dessert had to be bought and this bakery was only a mile from the restaurant where we had lunch, so we embarked on our gluten free dessert journey. I was very impressed. They had samples of the lemon poppyseed cake in a bowl on the counter. Everyone loved the taste and texture of the cake. Sometimes gluten free desserts can be dry and crumbly, but nothing we got from here had that problem. My mom and I both got brownies and they were probably the best gluten free brownies I've had. They were rich but not too rich and I'm still impressed at how they weren't dry or crumbly at all. I also got a ginger cookie and it was really good too. It had a nice ginger flavor without being overwhelming. The shop is pretty small, but I guess that's not unusual in NY. It probably only fits maybe 10 people at once. Both the girls that work there were really nice and they had a good selection.

I went yesterday with my family on Father's Day and was met with with rude service and mediocre coffee. Look through my reviews - you'll see that I rarely, if ever rate businesses this low if that's any indication of how upsetting this experience was.  My family came in on a slow Sunday afternoon, and decided to grab some coffee to stay. The barista was curt and dismissive, and didn't seem interested at all in taking my order.  We sat down and waited to receive our drinks while other later customers were served before us. I looked around, and we were the only patrons to not get latte art - even customers with paper to-go cups had some semblance of effort put into their milk foam while my sister's espresso drink was just plain.  My iced mocha was overly sweet and there was not enough ice, so it basically was a lukewarm chocolate coffee drink.  The staff basically ignored us after that, even when I tried to get their attention for another coffee. They were inattentive and stood deeper in the kitchen watching something on their phone.  I was embarrassed to bring my family here.

First, this location is at the bottom of an apartment complex, so I'm not even sure it's a real storefront with the full menu. Regardless, when we walked in there was no one at the counter - an AA guy eating his food looked up in annoyance and walked over to take our order. Excuse me, I believe this is your job.  Ordered a ice green tea latte. The guy clearly kept looking over at the iPad to see if we would tip. I didn't like the initial lack-thereof greeting, so I didn't tip, surprise surprise. The coffee was also $5+ already.  By this time, the guy was clearly not bothering to hide his annoyance. He grabbed the physical tip jar from the other side of the counter and moved it in front of us. The audacity.  I ignored him. He proceeded to dump ice to the top of the cup.

Coffee Clock,4,I went yesterday in this place because is close to my job and I take the mozzarella sandwich I ask can have hot and they give me cold sandwich and I said ok Today I went for the breakfast and I take omelette sandwich and I ask which bread you use and guy told me we use plain croissant and also I said I would like my sandwich hot . Ok I take the sandwich and I go back to work I open the box the croissant was whole wheat and the sandwich was cold so I went back and I told them I don't like the whole wheat stuff and I ask if I can have toast my sandwich because I don't like cold the girl take the croissant and put in the microwave now this sandwich is disgusting is mushy not Crunchy and the best part is the croissant is that I will never go back in this place they don't listen and don't understand,1,11/8/2018,1,0,0,40.7696608,-73.9573855
Coffee Clock,4,"AWFUL. I just received my 3 desserts and they are so small they fit into 18cmX11.5 cm box.  I really can't believe the portion size is this small, this is like the total opposite of the SuperSize me option from the Golden Arches, it's like Minimize Me portion option( if it were available).  I love having a nice dessert and what is astonishing is that one piece of cake from Harbs is the size of all three that i ordered.  If you take the largest piece of cake in the picture, it might be size wise the same as ONE slice from harbs but not weight/quality.  Can't overstate how disappointed I am... I will never order from this place again.  25 dollars for something you can buy at costco for 10$ and Costco taste better..

They have a couple of seasonal specialty coffee drinks (currently along the lines of pumpkin spice and caramel apple).  They have a drink on the regular menu called Honey RAF Coffee.  I asked what this was and the cashier said it was honey, coffee, and milk mixed together.   I decided to try it.  When the barista gave it to me, it had a nice smell; the heat warmed up the honey and produced a pleasing scent.  It was topped with a nice thick layer of foam that was enjoyable.  Underneath, however, I feel like the honey was masking poor or average-tasting coffee.  Once the foam was gone it was kinda meh.  I appreciate that they had a short list of specials.  There is a lot of space in the back and I appreciated getting warmed up.  They also get points for having 8oz drinks on offer.

The barista informed me that they had a buy 2 get one free deal on pastries, and he recommended the carrot and raisin loaf (I can't remember the name). It was okay, and had too many raisins for my taste.  I also got a chai spice latte. This is did not like.

Given that I'm usually studying/have little time for a regular meal in some cases, their protein bar does wonders. It's rare to say a protein bar tastes good, but these are addicting. Luckily they're super filling, so one is enough for a while. If I could, I'd buy these in bulk.

Their Walnut Banana Bread is really good, not too dense. They also have a giant Rice Krispie treat made with Chex, which is my guilty pleasure.  They woo me now and again by dropping $2 in my LevelUp account every few months.  There is a lot of space to sit/work with laptops, but they are usually taken.

Gregory۪s Coffee,4,I got the cold brew iced coffee with almond milk and vanilla. I'm sorry but I can't get over how good my coffee is. Also I'm usually a really fast drinker with my morning coffees but I've had it for half an hour. I'm really cherishing every sip. It's making me so damn happy. 1. The cup: quality is a+. Very thick and had a cute photo of Gregory and you could tell they put in a lot of work to making sure they have great quality cups. Also I noticed in their cafe by the straw area they had a big tub of lemon water for people to take with thick posh plastic cups. This also goes for their straws. Amazing texture and quality. 2. The aroma. You could just tell by the smell of the brew how dope it is. Sends shivers down my spine. 3. The fricken taste. I don't even know where to begin. From the second the coffee reaches my mouth through the straw it's like this crazy sensation. I just want to hug it. The strong coffee flavor. That fricken brew though. I can't explain it. And they put the perfect proportion of coffee to almond milk and vanilla. Like wow. The atmosphere of the place was great. It had a whole rustic Brooklyn coffee shop vibe that's hard to find. You could tell how much effort and happiness went into my cup of coffee. Service was great. Baristas were so happy to be there and serve me.

Gregorys Coffee,4,"Gregorys Coffee will always and forever make me think of my friend India; she worked at one of the original locations near Penn Station five summers ago for a whopping three weeks before starting her PhD program, but I remember always traveling down there just to get her to make me dirty chais. Ahhhh, memories from the summer of 2011...  Anyways...  I needed a place to crash for a few hours between the end of my work day and a 7:30 p.m. dinner. I wasn't too keen to the idea of sitting in my office for another two hours, and sitting at a Starbucks didn't appeal to me, either. After some searched, I was excited to see that Gregorys opened an UES location near Hunter College (...and I'm even more excited to see one will be opening soon, just one block away from my UES office! YASSSS!). I entered and was pleased to see a cheery place with lots of seating up front and in the rear. I ordered my chai and a piece of chocolate rugelach to and retreated to the rear to cozy up with my book for a few hours. The rugelach was delicious with a good balance of cinnamon and chocolate, and the chai borders more on authentic rather than just some chai concentrate; the notes of anise were omnipresent, which I liked.  I'm glad there is a Gregorys in this part of the city. And once its location on 68th and 1st opens, I know I'll be saying buh-bye to Starbucks when my mid-day chai cravings hit.",1,2/11/2016,3,0,1,40.76646898,-73.96528566

I really liked the vibe upon entering, dark enough to be cozy but warm and bright enough to be welcoming for a rainy morning. It's got a very Brooklyn-feel for a Manhattan coffee shop honestly. It feels very comforting, like they'd like you to stay awhile, maybe that's to do with the oversized furniture, and the warm lights but it's very nice.  I was greeted by the barista as I walked through the door, and she gave me a second to check out their extensive menu. I ended up getting a small cold brew (they only have small and large in iced drinks). In the subsequent times I've been back whoever is at the register has always been friendly. The condiment bar was very well set up and in keeping with the rest of the shop. They were well stocked and had honey, which is always a plus.  The coffee as very good and reasonably priced and it seemed like a lovely environment. I'll definitely be back and try some of their other selections. I am pleased to have found this place!  I've now tried their hot drip coffee (excellent), cold brew (stellar), iced green tea green tea (perfectly brewed), and an iced latte (divine). I also had the berry scone which was delicious, perfect amount of density and sweetness.

I asked the guy making my latte how much the chocolate bar was, still in shock from the snack that cost more than lunch.  He said they are $12.  I asked why the bars were $12 and he responded, ""why are you paying $6 for a latte?""  He said it was because they are ""artisanal.""  I said they should put an ""artisanal"" sign next to it so people know what they are getting into.  But you know what, Rude, you're right.

The avocado with the poached egg was very sour for some odd reason and there was waaaay too much olive oil. It was piled on top of a sweet potato and topped with some sesame seeds and what I believe to be fennel seeds (not completely sure). The combination of it all was not bad but weird. I ended up picking around the things I liked and didn't like. I usually never have a bad cup of coffee when I visit NY, but for some reason their cappuccino held an over powering citrus taste.

Irving Farm New York,3.5,"We are always looking for good coffee places while traveling. Specifically single origin coffee which has become a favorite to drink. While in CA we just buy beans and do a pour over at home. However while traveling it becomes harder to find good places just because we are unfamiliar with the area. We found this place with all the right set up and the coffee was freshly roasted. You have the option of pour over hot or cold.  I've never had a cold pour over but it sounded interesting. The hot pour over was perfectly put together. Fresh beans, right temperature, and timing made the coffee taste clean. We got the Papa New Guinea and the Peruvian pour over. Both very well brewed (not sure if that's the right word for pour over. Still pretty new at the specialty coffee scene.). We shared an avocado toast which was tasty. They had a topping to the avocado toast which was new to me but gave the avocado toast better flavor than just salt.  Pickled is the best term I can come up with.  (They were little balls. Again excuse my silly lack of language skills.). The place is simple with bare brick walls as well as black subway tile on one side and white subway tile on the other.  Nice place to sit for coffee as well as order from a menu full of breakfast/lunch items. They also had pastries like donuts and muffins to choose from but I was too full to try any.

But this time we sat and were working on our laptops on a Friday afternoon (as pretty much everyone does in a coffee shop in the 21st century). We all bought drinks and I bought an extra granola bar bc they have no good healthy breakfast food options-- btw this granola bar was $3.

When we then explained that if we needed to move we have to leave, since we wouldn't have place for our laptops so we could work, she just walked away.

Many senior people and people of color will take offense to this because during JIm Crow period in American History this was how store owners showed they did not want to do business with people of color. Very sad thing  I was just at Java Girl Inc on East 66th  Street and got coffee and this young English women took my money then just placed my change in front of me as I looked at her ...

Java Girl,4,"Charming, cozy, warm = cramped. For the sake of courtesy, stay away if you have just eaten a monster burrito or hit up an unlimited brunch, because the tables and chairs barely fit, let alone the people. After downing several cups of tea, I was dying for a bathroom but there just didn't seem to be enough space for one. Barista was a bit stiff and seemed to have a problem explaining what loose tea leaf was, but maybe I was just having problems digesting my monster carnitas burrito and couldn't understand basic English.  Also, do not get the egg salad sandwich with dill on croissant. Utterly flavorless. The dill was nowhere to be found.  I know cilantro gets a bad rep because certain members of the populace think it tastes like bitter soap, but on the whole, spices are our friends!  Also, I'm sorry to the guy whose coat got splattered on when I tripped over my feet and spilled half of my $3 hot chocolate everywhere. It looked really expensive. I was going to offer to pay for the dry cleaning but you huffed and packed everything up in a hurry, and then I got to sit on your nicely warmed-up cushion, so I like to think everything balanced out in the end.

Just know that it's worth going to, if only to lift your spirits.  This is a good place to meet a friend for a quick coffee.

Java Girl,4,"I was pleased to find this little ""hole in the wall"" next door to my new apt. With a Starbucks on every other corner, Java Girl is a breath of fresh air. Tired of lattes and cappuccinos,  I go for the brewed coffee which, in my opinion, is 10x better than anything Starbucks offers. With a variety of beans and roasts Java Girl has something for everyone's taste buds. Small 12 oz runs 1.80 and the large 18 oz is 2.20. In addition to coffee they carry delicious croissants and cookies to munch on.  A few ""rules"" as other have noted: no outside food, CC min. of $10. Some reviewers seem disturbed by these. But they're not  unusual or outrageous requests. Many businesses follow the same practices. The venue is truly a hole in the wall with minimal and cramped seating.

Not to mention the croissants/pastries were great and the mood and decor of the place is awesome.  Tips - if you are used to more classic versions of chai, Java Girl's are sweet, so ask for less vanilla/sweetener if you're going to try a chai creme.  If you are used to Starbucks' version of a mocha, get Java Girl's ""hot chocolate with espresso"".  Their regular mochas are quite unsweet.",1,11/15/2012,1,0,0,40.7641801,-73.9594657

I lived on 66th street for 6 years and went there almost every day, and not just for coffee.  They have a tiny kitchen, that churns out high quality pressed sandwiches.  The tuna melt is great, made with freshly chopped veggies and not too much mayo.  I also really enjoy the turkey sandwich.  The coffee is outstanding, blows away just about every other place in the city.  It is pretty small, but I always seem to be able to grab a table and sit for a while- though sometimes you might share it.  It's not all about high speed internet in here either, it is a social vibe with some good satellite radio tunes, usually something latin or maybe Jazz (or even Latin jazz).

We  usually go to the 9th Ave location. The staff there are typically also so friendly and welcoming. I actually deleted my Starbucks app because Kahve had great coffee and amazing people. However today I experience an awful trip to Kahve. I met the rudest barista and an embarrassing moment over my reward card. Basically I ordered two drinks. one for my self and one for my co-worker (it was my turn to treat) I  had an four different cards with all different stamps. I had an snowflake, a flower, stars and little feet. I had one card complete filled which I wanted to redeemed. Yet the barista refused to honor my card because he calmed they only used one kinda stamp and it was not the one I currently had filled. Like I mention before I have cards with for different things on them. I paid for my drinks but was beyond embarrassed with the whole express. The barista basically called me a liar in front of my co-worker and the other customers waiting online.

Lots of teams attending the US Open were here but regardless, the staff were friendly, quick and the atmosphere of the bar is really lovely with deep velvet couches, a nice wine selection and they bring delicious complimentary bites---quick fried stuffed olives, smoked mixed nuts and other bites. It was a very relaxed place where everyone was just hanging out having casual drinks with no rush by the staff. Note--large wine pours :).

Knave,3.5,"This really is a one star review, but the flavor of the coffee makes it two.  On Christmas morning, after my jaunt around Manhattan, I needed breakfast, badly.  Sadly, my Yelp app failed to update on things that were ""open"" that morning, and I wandered into here for some grub.  I wanted a full breakfast, but what I got was a mishmash of items and horrible service.    I'll start with the food/drinks- I ordered a pain du chocolat (which they were out of) so I had to settle for a croissant.  I added a fruit cup, bellini, and latte.  The beverages were both fabulous, and well worth the wait.  The food was meh and not worth the money.    The atmosphere could be cozy if it wasn't so cold outside and the doors weren't constantly opening and closing.  A frigid draft ran through me roughly every two minutes.    Now onto the service...I often cringe when I see reviews from others- wondering if they have ever spent time in the service industry: dealing with difficult people, being short-staffed and in the weeds, and having to work their asses of since all income is based on tips and whether or not the person in front of you knows how to do math (much like how the written English language has deteriorated, I believe that we are doomed as a society based on math skills).  Unlike those who have never received $2.62 on a $40 check (my service was just fine, just angst-ridden teenagers who apparently spent all their money on attitudes), I have spent many, MANY years in the service industry.  I currently wait tables because I need the money and it's a nice way to keep me humble.  Working in the service industry has made me infinitely more and less patient when I'm out enjoying the service of others.  Wait, that didn't sound right.  In any case, I am VERY patient when I see a server who is clearly overwhelmed but trying very hard to make each and every table know that they are special.  I am EXTREMELY impatient when I see a server who is busy, but doesn't bother to let me know that a) I exist, b) that I am worth her time, and c) that she is worth my tip.    I sat there for a good 10-15 minutes before I was even acknowledged (a ""hi, I'm busy but I'll be right back"" goes a long way), got my order taken at ludicrous speed, got my food dropped off with nary a word, and got my check with as much enthusiasm as someone delivering chlamydia results.  Service sucked- there's no way around it.  It's not like I go around wearing a sign that says ""hi, I'm  a server too"" (as I shouldn't have to), and I realize that on Christmas Day she was probably short-staffed, but she really was crappy.  And by she, I mean the blond of European roots.    For the prices I expected more.  For the service, I hope she didn't expect 20%, because she sure didn't deserve it.",1,1/2/2013,6,6,3,40.7643945,-73.97839027

Knave,3.5,"Yes, its beautiful inside (the photos will tell you that much) and yes there is nice music playing, and the ceilings are very high, but to me this was still a somewhat cramped kind of space, especially for the price you'll need to pay.  The lovely lounge chairs seem to fill up quickly.  This is not a place to go if you have a group of over 3 people.  One person was kind enough to let my friend and I share space with them.  I wouldn't mind if the prices weren't completely STUPID.  Pint of Guinness for $12?  A bottle (I assume 12 oz) of Ommegang for $9?  Glasses of wine that start at $16?  Seriously, I doubt the bottles of the wines they offered were more than the price per glass.  I would have been OK paying $18 for a glass of Brunello di Montalcino, but $18 for a glass of Beaujolais is a bit too much.  I can only assume that most of Knave's clientele have enough money to play with that the excessive pricing isn't an issue.  You could consider this a good romantic spot to bring a date for a drink IF you can find a comfortable place to sit that you won't need to share at some point.  (seriously, at those prices part of the cost should be total privacy)  However,  if you are just looking for a place to go and aren't blessed with a plethora of spending money I think you should probably look elsewhere for a drink.  I would be willing to come back here for an espresso drink of some kind.  It seems like this is their strong suit, so its possible I've mis-judged the place.  I'll give it a shot after another trip to Burger Joint, and I might just need to revise the rating up a bit.",1,9/7/2011,1,0,1,40.7643945,-73.97839027
Knave,3.5,"Knave uses some excellent counter culture coffee and the baristas are skilled which is a great recipe for excellent coffee and there are also nice lemon and anise flavored cookies served with each cup. The drinks served are also good and I do like the atmosphere of the place. Service is not great,usually slow and not very friendly. If I would disregard the prices it would be great but the fact that they charge $6 for a cappuccino is just way too much even in New York. My advise would be to go to the Burger Joint (in the same hotel) have lunch and then ask for the receipt that gives you 2 for 1 coffees at Knave.",1,4/1/2012,1,0,0,40.7643945,-73.97839027
Knave,3.5,"Checked into the hotel but had to wait on my room as it was not ready yet.  Not a problem, I expected that since it was only 1pm and they upgraded me to a suite.  I decided to stop by this coffee bar for a cappuccino and surf the Internet to pass some time by as it is too damn cold outside.    The bar lounge area is very Old World.  Flickering candles with marble tables, marble flooring, Victorian chairs of dark wood and leather cushions.  They also have plush ottomans.  A very cozy place indeed.    The prices for their beverages are a little pricey.  I did not think the coffee prices were to bad, $6 for a cappuccino.  Beer was running $9-$12, wine $14 and brunch cocktails were about $18.  This is a really cool place to just lounge around and enjoy conversation with friends.  I did notice most people did not stay long.  Probably due to the prices of the drinks.

I always feel like the food must be pretty good here too because its packed and everyone is eating, but that could also just be the nature of midtown. I don't vibe with the atmosphere  in here, so I've never stuck around to try the food.  The music euro electronic ish.. which can be cool in the right setting. I can see how a lot of people dig this place, but it gets a little overwhelming for me to hang out here for more than a few minutes. I like to feel more relaxed and get a break from the hustle and bustle on my caffeine breaks. Its strange to feel calmer when you walk OUT the door into busy streets outside Grand Central haha.  Espresso is good and strong, but I prefer the lighter and sweeter flavor of the Cappuccino's at Joe's in GC.",1,11/8/2011,3,1,1,40.7527018,-73.9744492
Macchiato Espresso Bar,4,I'm not sure if I just had a one off bad experience because based on the cappuccino I ordered I can't think of any redemptive qualities for Macchiato Espresso Bar.  Let's first review the technical details:  - Locally roasted coffee beans: No. They source from Fonte roasters in Seattle. - Baristas with proper training on pulling espresso & steaming milk: No. -  Quality Milk Brand: Elmhurst Dairy - Microfoam quality and Latte Art: No  The Cap I ordered looked much more like a latte than a cap in terms of size. What's up with people not understanding the difference between these two drinks? A cappuccino should not exceed 6 oz. The drink they served me was easily 8+ oz and even if I judged it as a Latte it was still not made properly. The milk lacked proper microfoam and there wasn't even an attempt at latte art. I couldn't even finish my drink and had to bail on it after a few sips. Just didn't taste right at all. For this I give them 1 star. Sorry!,1,6/29/2011,3,0,1,40.7527018,-73.9744492

Macchiato Espresso Bar,4,"Five stars for their incredibly good coffee, lovely presentation, nice decor and great staff,  but one star off for the noise/crowd.  We did manage to find a seat but we were unfortunate to be seated next to a pair self-important women with piercing voices who felt that everyone around should count themselves lucky to hear their vapid utterances.  That cannot be blamed on the cafe, but maybe on the low ceilings. The quality of the coffee and the service totally made up for those voices.  Service was really friendly, professional and quick.  When I looked up to the register to see if I could catch the cashier's eye, she seemed to be anticipating my question and was friendly and quick with an answer.    If you read my other reviews, you will know that I have Battered NYC Consumer syndrome, a result of too much time spent around surly cashiers in places like Kinkos (shudder) and Whole Foods (ptooey).  I curl up and purr when I hear ""please"" and ""thank you""...and then I start doling out the stars like a drunken sailor.  I give them out to Machchiato with pleasure.  p.s. boy watching wasn't too bad here, if you're into that.  9/17/08 update: a friend, who was alerted to the great coffee at Joe's, a few scant blocks from Macchiato, went into Macchiato carrying a coffee from Joe's (only went in because his friend wanted an egg sandwich). When they got to the counter the cashier asked my friend where he got his coffee.  He told them Joe's and they offered to replace it with a cup of their coffee.

MarieBelle,4,"If you don't care about the cleanness of their products good for you! I know I won't go there again.  I was in a really good mood to pick up a box of chocolates from this place a few days ago for my bf since it also has been one of my favorites for holiday gifts (recommended by my boss who is French) but the people who worked there totally ruined it for me.  First of all, the lady who was helping me dropped the lid of the chocolate box to the ground but she picked it up like nothing had happened, I instantly felt really uncomfortable but was too shocked to voice my concerns. I normally wouldn't make a big deal out of it if the staff drop products by accident but that is part of the container to hold food, and when incidents like this happened in the past at other stores the staff threw away the box right away and picked up new ones.  Anyway, I eventually asked her to give me a new lid when she was about to close the box and she was like ""okay...?"" and gave me the face like I was overreacting. I apologized when she came back even when I really didn't have to and explained why I asked for a new lid, but she gave me this awkward silent treatment throughout the rest of the experience. Whoa! On top of over-priced chocolates now I have to put up with the attitudes? MarieBelle is too much for the good holiday vibes.  After I gave my bf the box of pretty chocolates I realized there is also a piece of thin layer of protector that they put on top of the chocolates before closing the lid, and I think she had dropped that as well when she dropped the lid ""by accident""... I am now telling my bf to throw away those chocolates and I am buying something from other places that take hygiene seriously. I saw the lady who helped me just put the lid that she had picked up from the floor back to the tack and it has probably been purchased by someone who doesn't know. I also read one of the past reviews saying that they sold expired chocolates and when the costumer reached out they simply asked them to peel off the expiration date label... who knows if their other stuff is even safe to eat.

MarieBelle,4,"I went there yesterday afternoon and had a dinner with a friend of mine at the coffee bar in the back of the store. It was superb! Johnny, our waiter, took very good care of us, the food was very good and we were also introduced to the pastry Chef, a tiny, pretty and adorable woman, that was also very pleasent.  After such great time, we decided to shop for some treats at the front store, and for our surprise, we had a very very bad time. The sales person - INBAR her name, if I am not wrong - was very rude trying to rush us, saying that ""they were already closed and that she had more things to do"". Just horrible. We were buying more than a hundred dollars in chocolates and we were being treated like SH%#.  At the same time, she said to a guy that was waiting for her if he could ""help her out with the vacuum, so she could get THE HELL OUT OF THERE SOON.""  It has been a very long time since I last saw such horrible sales person. I really don't know what she is doing there. She cannot work as a front person, she hates her job and she probably hates people in general.  I have been working with customer service for a long time and I know how hard it can be sometimes, but I would never, ever, treat someone like that. And if someone under my management have this kind of attitude, he or she will be fired RIGHT AWAY.  As a business owner myself, I recommend to MarieBelle Shop to get rid of this person that is just ruining their business and hire more people like the waiter Johnny and the sweet pastry Chef.",1,8/1/2017,0,0,0,40.72321077,-74.00245063

You walk in to an adorable bit of ""fancy"" and are in the shop. The cacao bar is in the back of the store, so we moseyed on back and were seated pretty quickly. My gods was it good! I had the Iced Hazelnut chocolate and Blueberry Mousse cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. My friend had the Iced Aztec chocolate with their Louvre cake. We nibbled/sipped from each. As the gentleman behind the cacao bar made chocolate drinks for patrons, he'd bring thimbles of excess to other guests to try. So, on top of what we ordered, we also had a taste of the spicy hot chocolate.  So, here we go:  Spicy hot chocolate: Smooth with a little hint of a kick. Not enough to make anyone be scared of the heat, but enough to notice it. I'll absolutely get this sometime, and I am NOT one to order hot drinks. Iced Aztec chocolate: Wonderful and somewhat sweet. Classic flavor, just cold. The perfect iced ""hot"" chocolate. Iced Hazelnut chocolate: Delissssshhhhh. I'm also biased for hazelnut. But, it wasn't overpowering like hazelnut syrups can sometimes be. It was great cold. Louvre cake and Blueberry Mousse: Both were perfect.

MarieBelle,4,"(Part Three of the NYC Food Crawl - Hot Chocolate Crawl; 1/15/12)  I have been a fan of the Mariebelle boxes for years now. I've enjoyed the rich chocolate in the comfort of my own kitchen. When I came across this storefront during the hot cocoa crawl, I just about jumped with joy!  Then...reality hit me.  For every stop, one person of the team ""bought rounds"" for the rest of the team. That amounted to three medium-sized cocoas and six cups for everyone. Before arriving, I said I'd buy the rounds at Mariebelle. I immediately regretted that decision upon seeing the 10 oz. ""large"" size cups, then had to grin and bear it when I actually had to pull out my debit card and write ""$26.15"" in the total column.* The $6 ""small"" size was, quite literally, the equivalent to a shot. After a brief yet controlled hyperventilation, I brought the cocoa back to my team mates.  The verdict? Perhaps we should have gone for the $6 dollar ""shots"", because these cocoas are rich. In fact, I would not even call them cocoas. I would call them thick chocolate syrups. The taste? Absolutely divine. There is no doubt about that. However, we all left overwhelmed and barely able to finish what I bought. We actually had to go to a store down the street to buy some water to cleanse our palates. We could feel the chocolate coursing through our veins.  A fine, rich, and pure product, worth five stars, but, in the future, I'll stick to buying a box of the cocoa to bring home and making it my way on my own time.  * - As my friend and team mate Carrissa stated, ""You know you are in trouble when you are pulling out a debit card to pay for hot cocoa.

Heaven in a little mug!  Yes, that little mug that they called a medium was $8, but really, what good dessert in the City doesn't cost at least $8?  The gentleman I was with ordered the dark chocolate - which wasn't as thick as the spicy, but was just as smooth and rich.    Indeed, his passion for chocolate is like nothing I have ever seen - yet he found his match at MarieBelle!    If the hot chocolate isn't reason enough for you to venture to MarieBelle - and believe me, it's reason enough - the atmosphere and friendly service might also persuade you.  We came in right as they were closing, but they let us order and ""dine-in.""  Even though they locked the doors and were cleaning up, they didn't rush us for a moment.  Plus, the decor was fun and sophisticated with chandeliers, mirrors, and art.

Only after opening the box and sampling a piece with my wife did I also realize  that the date was expired. I returned the box of chocolates to the Greenpoint store only to be told by the manager that he could not help me, implying that i  tampered with the chocolate.

Mirrors eveyrwhere, regal indigo colors and divine chocolate scattered on the shelves seducing me with their forms and smell!! I feel like Im Alice in Wonderland.  Next room has cute little tables and sparkling chandeliers. try mint chololate balls, macaroons and of course infamous hot chocolate.  Staff is amazing but the only problem is their shortstaffed so the service is very slow. everything is made from scratch so the hot choclate lets say, takes some time to get. well, good things come to those who wait but its NYC where the seconds count a minutes.

MarieBelle,4,Need a break from shopping? Marie Belle was a perfect place to escape the cold and grab a cup of tea and some delicious chocolately sweets.  I very much enjoyed my black lychee tea and dark chocolate florentine cookie. The tea salon is behind the chocolate shop at the front. I couldn't resist the chocolate sample on the way out but OMG $5 for one little piece of chocolate. That's crazy talk. I'm convinced they put crack in it.,1,11/28/2010,1,1,1,40.72321077,-74.00245063

The staff was pleasant and helpful when my husband and I were attempting to choose what we would eat and drink. However, the waiter failed to inform us that the kitchen was closed when we were ready to order our dessert.    So, here are the pluses and wishes: Pluses: So many choices for hot chocolate! Milk, Dark, White...have your pick!  I enjoyed the dark hot chocolate, but beware...a small cup size is sufficient.  The milk hot chocolate with hazelnut was sumptuous as well! The food was also good. We had sandwiches (ham & cheese and turkey).  Both went well with the hot chocolate.  Wishes: I wish I could give a review of their desserts! However, the place closes at 8pm (on a FRIDAY!) so at 7:30pm, there was clearly a push to get us out the door.

A little too rich for my taste, but you're talking to a salty-carb girl. The lighter iced chocolate was perfect-- light, frothy, and delicious.

So I'd say Mariebelle is doing a damn fine job, considering their New York location is quite clearly not in Europe.  Order it milk-based or water-based, however you like it.  The little cafe also serves light appetizers and sandwiches to enjoy along with your cocoa, as well as non-alcoholic, slightly-alcoholic, and highly-alcoholic drinks.  Before the cafe area are the chocolates.  They're wonderful, they are, and look very pretty too.  Mariebelle easily offers the most colorful and decorated ganache I've seen yet.

Very impressed with the store's branding and decor - very adorable.  The cocoa salon was tucked away in the back of the store with limited seating.  I had a small white chocolate and vanilla in a darling cup, a tad larger than an espresso cup and the hubby had a the dark mocha in a medium cup.  Very rich and flavorful chocolate and you will need extra water.  Good thing dark chocolate is good for you and he didn't regret the amount once consumed.

MarieBelle,4,"The hot and iced chocolate both get five stars, though you gotta be careful with their hot chocolate.  It's almost too good to drink.  The Cacao Bar is a very cute spot, but make sure you're at leisure.  The servers are very nice but have managed to forget something from my order every time I've been.  They do serve sandwiches and savory nibbles, but I would go somewhere else for that.  I tried the leek and goat cheese crepe once and the portion was ridiculously small for $11.  My sister's gruyere and turkey sandwich, $8, was huge in comparison.  As far as sweets go, the alfajors are curiously lemony, while the almond flavor in the macarons is a bit too heavy.  Also, they have tiny European-sized water glasses, but the staff rarely comes around to refill them.  I would recommend the Cacao Bar as a great place to get warm after shopping with ladies on a cold winter's day, or to grab a hot chocolate to go, but not for eating. The shop itself is beautiful and a great place to buy chocolate gifts.

It is addicting ... unbelievably chocolatey and drinkable.  We might even be talking about a chocolate intervention.  And the salon itself, decor, atmosphere, is fantastic.

MatchaBar,3.5,"As others have commented, this latest bastion of MatchaBar is in an absolutely adorable neighborhood. Just off the L, A, C, and E, picture millennials walking little dogs past bike racks and juice bars, and you get the picture. Gentrified beyond belief, but dang if it isn't endearing.  My first observation is ""Ok, so we're going with the artsy wood look."" You know the type - wood paneling, a lot of greenery, some coloring books - the kind of hip Starbucks could have been if it were able to keep up. My second observation: ""It is PACKED in here."" 7 people seated, 4 in line, and then I made 12; that should speak to the size of the place (and oddly, 10 of our number were women.) Unfortunately my 2:30 stop-in seemed to be contributing to their afternoon rush, which their solitary barista was ill-equipped to handle. She was fast, but this is an involved process and I don't blame her a bit for the wait.  In a house of health, I choose what have to be the least healthy options. Matcha hot chocolate (whole milk) - $5.25 and cheddar scallion scone - $3.50. All told, pretty much the same prices you'd find anywhere else. The pastries are provided by Balthazar, so you know you're in for something good there, but I got my matcha start at Resobox in LIC, so meeting that mark would be MatchaBar's real challenge.  The matcha hot chocolate was definitely tasty, and I appreciated that it was served at a temperature that didn't sear my tastebuds off. Matcha is a very powerful flavor though, and it tended to overwhelm the chocolate a bit. Additionally, I'd recommend to all who are able to stick to whole milk for this - its weight and creaminess would be sorely missed otherwise. As for the cheddar scallion scone, it was excellent - you can tell that it was made in the wee hours of the morning and not recently, but it didn't suffer too badly and was all-around enjoyable.  If you're thinking of coffee on this corner, I'd certainly recommend stopping in at MatchaBar. It offers a novel experience and a tasty drink for a cold day.

Matto Espresso,4.5,"After hearing about this little cafe down the street, I finally tried it. There is such a wonderful selection of items and I can't believe everything is $2. From what I can tell everything is of really good quality and nothing seems to be cheap as would be the assumption since everything is at this price point. The portions are obviously smaller with everything being $2 but that is just fine. I really like their lattes. They are so much better then the ones I get at Starbucks or Prete and you get it is a regular sized coffee cup. I also had one of their breakfast sandwiches, which was also very good.  The reason why I am giving Matto only 2 stars is because they need to label their ingredients. People, INCLUDING ME, have a nut allergy and a red flag for me was when I looked at their pasta salad and there was no listing for walnuts and then you look at the salad and there are walnuts. I also got their feta sandwich, which has a pesto in it, took 2 bites a knew something was wrong. I proceeded to have an allergic reaction, which luckily isn't terrible but still is enough to ruin my afternoon. There vegitable sandwich has the same pesto, which also has walnuts and is not labelled as such.  A lot of the pastries in their have the potential to have nuts and you can't tell just by looking at it and sometimes the workers are not versed on ingredients, especially something like spreads that might be bought pre-made. Sorry to gripe about this but this is important. I would continue coming to Matto for their coffee, for sure, but potentially little else.",1,12/4/2017,5,2,2,40.7502408,-73.9777519

Ninth Street Espresso,4,"Dangerously close to work, pleasantly Italian. While you can have it to go and in different sizes, the cappuccino at Ninth Street Espresso is the real deal, quite possibly better than the original, in that they really take their time to whip it up. Or foam it up. Also relevant that different baristas manage to keep the quality and texture consistent, which I think that's where many other coffee places struggle with. But please, take it ""to stay, and small"". The sweets are intriguing and well presented, although I found some to be overly, well,  sweet. The banana chocolate bread is different than the usual and it has that ""baked at home"" feel, which depending on your prowess with the oven might be a scary proposition. In that scenario, the coconut sandwich with chocolate filling is the perfect, unorthodox dipping candidate. It works, all the time.  Ninth Street Espresso does not like your credit cards, so don't even try to swipe one. They also don't want you to seat comfortably, as coffee should be served ""by the bar"", as they have it in Italy. The couple of stools do the job, but a larger group won't be happy.

Just like no croissant you've ever had in your life?! I could not be more disappointed. It most closely resembles a hot dog bun.

Noglu,4,"Found this place recently - I was very excited to have found it given that it's French and gluten-free.  I can say that their banana and chocolate muffin is very good and moist.  I have had their blueberry almond muffin and double chocolate muffin - good, but not as good as their banana and chocolate muffin.  I recently tried their corn muffin and I found it to bre pretty good.  It was a little dry, but frankly most regular corn muffins tend to be dry, so I didn't find it problematic - the taste was there.  I have also had their shrimp salad and a grape/cucumber/goat cheese salad that I am eating right now and it's pretty tasty.  My major complaint is their croissant.  I couldn't believe my eyes that there sitting before my eyes was a gluten-free croissant made by a French person.  I could barely wait until I got home to eat it.  It was pretty terrible and it breaks my heart to have to say that because if anyone can create an awesome tasting croissant (gluten-free or otherwise) it would be the French.  That is precisely why I am writing this.  I was expected to be blown out of the stratosphere and I was so underwhelmed.  One reviewer said, ""as gluten-free eaters, we are used to mediocre"" - that is exactly why I am writing this review.  We need a revolt.  There is a solution to this and no one has found it yet.  Why the heck are we settling for bad food - on any level?  One should never, ever accept mediocrity (gluten-free or otherwise).  Yes, I am suggesting a revolution.  But mostly, I am hoping the owner reads this and realizes that she needs to push herself to raise her standard of her croissant.  It is not right that it is so blah.  It tasted like a mediocre American grocery store's version of a croissant and let's just say that this is no compliment.  Back to the kitchen on that one.  I have not tried any of the other pastries - I think this place has promise. . . they need to innovate a bit more.",1,6/27/2017,1,0,0,40.7838349,-73.9568862

Patent Coffee,4.5,"Pretty pretentious spot. Payment system set to add a 20 percent tip to your purchase unless you go out of your way to turn it off. Im sure lots of people dont even realize and end up accidentally tipping. Then, for a $6.50 cold brew w cbd, there are just a few drops of cbd, a cup full of ice and a coffee not filled to the top.  In response to management: so youre admitting you add a 20 perfect tip to all purchases unless the buyer realizes it and turns it off? We are not discussing the benefits of tipping. I am complaining that you sneak it in as a default. That is completely unethical. If you're charging what you charge for coffee, pay your staff a living wage. You shouldnt be depending on sneakily added tips to survive. Also, for $6.50 give me a full cup of iced coffee, not ice and a little coffee.

The ambiance is bright, sleek, and clean and there's never a huge crowd so grabbing a table or a seat on the bench on the sidewalk isn't a problem.  Their latte's are really freaking phenomenal.  They'll run you $4 or $5, depending on size, but are worth every penny. Their coffee (iced or hot) is very good as well.  And, on top of being the nicest staff around and making kick-ass coffee, they offer a punch-card so that your 10th drink is free. Bonus!

The lo-fi music, the cold beverage drink selections, amazing tea & coffee, (the super sexy salted caramel eclairs), the beautiful furnitures, the super friendly staffs, how some croissants double as a secret pizza..  HOWEVER,  There are these parents who bring their f-cking kids almost everyday and lets them RUN AROUND for hours in the nice chic french-style cafe.  I asked the manager to tell them to control their kids. Poor guy cringes and I see battles have been lost in the reflection of his eyes because something tells me he isn't new to this. He goes up to the mothers and says one thing as if he had repeated himself a million times and immediately, my sensitive ass knows this 6'8"" strong Latino man has been stripped of his power by these mothers. The mothers wave him off ""ok, whatever"" and if a 'sigh' can be in a human form, that's what he was for that moment.  These kids drive me insane and they're there every time I'm there, imagine how much therapy this manager needs from all of this. These children run and trip on chairs and bump into other human beings. I see adults roll their eyes, sigh frustratingly and have the madness bulging out of the veins of their foreheads.  If Recolte was a manifestation of a human mind, these mothers and their kids are definitely their demons, tormenting them everyday, sucking the good energy and  creating chaos in a place of peace. I imagine Recolte was not always  this way. The mind of Recolte is in desperate need of some ritualistic cleansing. YOUR BUSINESS DESERVES BETTER CUSTOMERS.  Recolte, PLEASE get a scarier mother to tell them off (as if the manager wasn't a big tough looking guy to begin with!) I understand mothers are SCARY but don't let these b-tches come haunting you. They may be mothers but to you, they are first and foremost bullies! This is out of control. Not all mothers are this selfish about their kids towards other people and gives mothers a bad rep.  Anyway, their golden milk latte is pretty solid. I also like that they carry elderflower soda. I always try something new when I am here.

He didn't acknowledge me and continued chatting with a friend or employee (not sure) he had just made a drink for. When he finally acknowledged me I asked if they had regular coffee or cold brew, he said it's all cold brew which is typical now so no big deal, I ordered a latte. He audibly sighed. More work I guess? They had skim and whole milk so I asked if he could do half skim half whole (also typical for coffee shops...) and he made a face like it was a crazy request and says ""I guess."" By that point I was just done and said I changed my mind and walked out. No reason to treat people that way. He was rude to the two women who came up behind me also.

I only dock a star b/c one time when I was there with a friend we saw a humongous rat scurrying in the corner of the back patio area. We decided to stay anyway the first time we saw it even though it seemed ginormous (seriously seemed twice the size of a normal rat) but after the second time it popped out we decided it was time to go. If this was a restaurant or inside I'd probably never return. It was an isolated incident though so hoping we just never see the mutant rat again.

In the front, is a small espresso bar that brews some truly amazing lattes.

Stone Street Coffee Company,4,"Call it growing pains...headed over to try Stone Street on a Saturday morning around 10:15am. I like to try and support new businesses in the hood and I was excited to sample an espresso and some pastry. The service window was open but the door was locked. A moment later a man appeared, unlocked the door and went inside. I tried to follow but he locked the door behind him.  I stuck my head in though the window and saw the man mopping the floor. I asked if they were open and without looking at me he said they were. I then asked if all orders had to be made through the window. He looked at me and said, ""That's why the window is open.""  I was already really annoyed so I didn't bother to point out that I was also hungry but none of the pastry could be viewed from the window. As a result I did not sample any food.  Instead of espresso I ordered a small coffee for two dollars. It was ordinary and the  ""barrista"" (who was clad in a ""wife-beater"" undershirt) added way too much milk resulting in a luke-warm brew and, it should be noted, that he couldn't even be bothered to say thank you after completing the transaction.  The coffee house competition in this city (and this neighborhood) is too great for a business to get by with such slip shod customer service.  To be fair, this may be just a bad morning at Stone Street so perhaps I will give them another try if I am walking by, but it won't be an experience that I will go out of my way for.",1,8/20/2011,5,2,2,40.7435886,-74.0032266
Stone Street Coffee Company,4,"Most annoying question when ordering a cappacino? What size. A proper cappacino is not measured in size, but rather three properly pulled shots of espresso, topped with about an ounce and a half of streamed milk and a dollop of foam. Two shots of espresso in an 8- to 12 ounce cup filled with milk does not a proper capp make. Starbucks gets this, as does Ninth Street Espresso, the latter my former personal New York favorite until my recent discovery of Stone Street.  Coffee is one of the few things in life about which I am a snob. Spoiled for years by The Conservatory for Coffee in Culver City, California, I had been consistently disappointed by the lack of quality coffee houses within reasonable distance of home and work here in New York. And while Ninth Street Espresso has been great, Stone Street has kicked it upstairs. To the C-Suite.  While not (yet?) privy to their roasting process, this is probably the first of two break-out distinctions here. Local roasting is rare in New York, and while others do it, Stone Street does it better. Every blend I've tried has exemplified an expert technique that brings out the full aroma and flavor of each.  And second, in terms of the perfect capp, is the milk, organic and sourced from a local upstate farm. A bonus... (And I probably shouldn't share this)... they sell it to me on the side with my purchase of ground beans to go, so my Capresso machine at home makes me $4 capps at home for under a buck. It is this attention to service and detail that really earned this five stars.  Starting each day with the proper cappuccino... the perfect blend of roast and milk... is like mainlining coffee and chocolate, and has greatly improved my morning mood and commute each day. A great accompaniment to, and something I hope to see soon ""In the Papers."" Some of you will get that and most won't. And it doesn't matter as long as I do.  Children of the Bean...

The one time I asked a barista to remake it she was incredibly rude. Today, I ordered an almond milk dirty chai. Upon receiving the chai I asked to confirm the barista if she put almond milk in it... to which she replied no. I then told her I asked for almond milk and if she could remake it and then she said ""oh actually I THINK I put almond milk in it."" Needless to say, as someone with lactose intolerance I felt anxious drinking the chai but I felt uncomfortable with the barista's way of avoiding remaking the drink.

Coffee is okay (alright at best) but I didn't mind because I came for the nice and cozy interior. At first, the girls at the counter were really nice but I realized after that I was deeply mistaken.

The Elk is also a small, tiny caf̩ and tables are about six to seven feet away from the counters so I heard everything they said. I was having a great day until this happened and I'm seriously disappointed and annoyed. There is nothing wrong with what I did and nothing wrong with taking pictures for instagram. Does that not benefit the caf̩ and the workers? Do posts not bring the caf̩ more publicity? Does that not give you more chances to get tipped by customers?

That is soooooo not cool, I don't know any place in NY where you have to pay for WiFi, that is absolutely ridiculous & will make your coffee shop the last resort to go to.

It's run by some unfriendly Asian lady that seems to only care to make a buck. The space is large, and they have nice tables to work on, but I have two main issues with this business. The main one is that it is not actually a legitimate bookstore as they claim. All of the book are basically just the same book but translated in all different languages. The book relates to some kind of religion, but I found it to be a bit uninviting for customers who may not follow that religion and are interested in other books (like a regular bookstore with books from all over the world) I wouldn't think a business like this would do well because of that. I recommend they grow their selection of books and this way I guarantee they will have more customers. Because the space is quite nice, but the music is bothersome & the books.. well.. there is none lol! The coffee and pastries are nice though.

Their spacious room will never be so packed.  Great coffee & tea at good price. Their cold brew coffee (12oz for $3.5) was very very good. Mild bitter and sweetness with deep aroma. I loved it so much that I asked them if they could give a coffee refill at discount price( !!! ) - unfortunately they don't ;) Their tea selection: Numi, mighty tea leaf, etc.  Mini matcha madeleines are rich in taste, soft and flavorful. Not-too-sweet, but just right sweetness. 3 for $4 Pistachio cheese cake is delicious, too. Again, not-too-sweet but just right sweetness! It was such a great idea of me to pair it with their mild bitter coffee. $6  I like the sounds of the water flowing. Free wifi and outlet. Classic music. The staff is super kind.

Underline Coffee,3.5,"NYC life is usually made better by coffee.  Not here.  Visited on a rainy, dreary day, for hope of a cheerful pick me up.  Nope.  First, the counter staff was flat out sullen, cold and hard of attitude.  I know this person can smile, banter and laugh as I saw this cashier and the barista doing so, loudly, the rest of the time while I was there.  Anti-humanist customer service.  Cashier: you are here to be pleasant and get orders efficiently taken and delivered.  Serving the customer is partially about being upbeat, positive and kind.  Didn't happen.  Now one could just let that go and enjoy food and beverage... but  those, also were nasty and unpleasant. I had an almond milk latte that tasted like the  milk was bad. Barely drank half of it and then, as I was there with a friend & didn't want to ask for a redo, just let the rest sit there untouched. A bad coffee at a coffee shop? How depressing.  The final insult to injury was the ricotta, strawberries, and balsamic toast. It looked (in the advertising photo) like it was on some lovely rustic white bread. Nope.  It was on the stalest piece of white bread that had been toasted so long ago that it was stone cold.  Oh, and not that I expected it to have a massive serving of strawberries, but there was barely one and a half strawberries cut up for each half slice of toast. Summarized: it was one piece of plain white bread, cut diagonally, thinly spread with the ricotta, and a total of 3 small hard strawberries cut up, sprinkled on it. The final yuck was that the accenting balsamic vinegar was poured onto the toast in such a way that it only hit the center part of the toast and none of the rest - soggy meet stale. It was truly a rip off at eight dollars and hardly edible.  TL/dr: For java and a snack, go to a well-known coffee chain or a bodega instead of here.",1,3/11/2019,3,0,0,40.74617643,-74.00612583

It's a very small space, simple design - very plain, little character and not even any music playing. Quiet. That's fine. The counter people were flat out Unfriendly. Not a smile to be seen. The coffee was good but expensive (almost $9 for two cold brews). We sat in the back area near the baristas and the vibe was quiet and awkward. We asked to use the restroom and were told no, they do not have one. A coffee shop - under the Highline (no bathrooms) - in the gallery district (most galleries don't allow you to use their bathrooms) - and Underline does not offer a restroom to their paying customers. Okay well, that's Unaccommodating (and certainly not encouraging of purchasing more beverages). Overall we were Unhappy there.

Underline Coffee,3.5,"I stopped in on Saturday at around 4pm after a long morning of gallery hopping.  This place has great curb appeal, very cozy and quiet.  Just as an intro, I own a small cafe myself so I can understand rushes and high volume times of day..... With that being sad this was the most unorganized cafe I have seen.  1.  The layout is bizarre, I highly recommend that the cashier and his IPAD register stay permanently at the front counter.  He was helping people who sat at the bar so when I walked in, along with other strangers, it was a bit confusing as to where we should order, follow the cashier around or stand with our backs against the wall near the bar?   --When customers come in coffee orders should be taken and paid for at the main counter, then customers should be left to either find a seat or wait for To-Go orders.       2.  I ordered a Cappuccino, what I got was no where near a Cappuccino.  They have an amazing Espresso machine, and the barista made a decent shot.... But he then poured it into an 6, maybe 8 ounce cup at most!  I didn't order a Cortado (equal parts steamed milk and espresso).  A single cappuccino should be served in a 10oz cup and a double should be somewhere around 12oz, ohh and it should be light creamy foam, not steamed milk, I got a Latte/ Cortado Combo pack.  I have no idea how many shots it was, they only have one size/price, but it was terrible.  I paid $3.75 for a drink I didn't order.  I want this place to do well but I walked out feeling disappointed with only half of a coffee.  I'm going back next week, so we'll see.",1,2/23/2014,0,0,0,40.74617643,-74.00612583

There are more seats if you wrap around the place, and even more seating in the back patio area which also has lovely plants.    Bathroom requires a code to use--ask an employee for the code.    What put a damper on the experience was the horrible owner.  She scolded us for bringing a birthday cake to surprise our friend because outside food is prohibited.  We didn't know, so the only thing we could do was apologize profusely, but the owner was relentless and rude.  She also suggested we should tip more because for reservations, they typically expect each person to spend at least $15.

The SMALL cappuccino I asked for was a huge cup of milk, even bigger than Starbucks. The chocolate croissant tasted like plastic and there was very little chocolate.

However, I felt that the product I received was sufficiently bad to warrant my notifying other potential customers. I came in with one very simple drink in mind: an iced oat latte. I had checked another shops beforehand with no luck. Oat milk is currently burgeoning, but definitely still relatively rare. When I stepped in here, I was pleased to be informed that the shop does indeed carry oat milk! Unfortunately, that moment was the extent of my excitement here. My latte came out tasting dirty, as in the machine hadn't been cleaned in who knows how long. Having worked as a barista in the past, I'm very familiar with the taste.

However today I was so disappointed in them I don't know if I'll return anytime soon.  My friend and I met here for lunch and she ordered a beet, ginger, and apple juice. About ten minutes later she started to feel really nauseous and asked if she could use their restroom.  The waitress said, ""we don't have one."" Okay weird, but whatever.  Another few minutes go by and my friend looked like she was going to be sick so she ran outside and had to throw up on the street. It was obviously all from the juice. I ran inside and told the waitress, ""I think the juice my friend had was spoiled because she just threw up on the street. Can we please use the restroom now?"" The waitress rolled her eyes and walked back to the restroom to ""check on it."" She walks back, ""sorry, someone's in there, you should probably go somewhere else; and I doubt it was the juice because its fresh squeezed."" Even though something is 'fresh squeezed' doesn't mean the fruit/veggies are 'fresh.'  I just couldn't believe they wouldn't help out a customer who just got sick from one of their products.

There isn't a lot of seating, but I have always been able to grab a table when I go there. I'm sure it depends what time you go though.  They also have a couple of benches outside so if you're able to snag them, it is a really nice place to sit outside on a beautiful day and people-watch. This is a great, peaceful street too.  I am giving them four stars because I really like the place and the atmosphere. (And most of the staff is nice, in my experience.)

Whether you are in the mood for awesome people watching, baked goods, seasonal eats or some seriously well made barista drinks this is my go-to-place.  For bevs, I usually order whatever I am in the mood for: dirty chai latte (best ever!), cappuccino, iced coffee (really quality stuff, not watered down Dunkin), vino or a high grav/craft beer. The baristas here really know what they're doing and you can tell that they use the good stuff.  For eats, everything here is fresh and thoughtfully prepared. They really get my vote because they use unexpected ingredients to avoid the 'typical' sandwich and salad selection at most joints. Plus, the menu is constantly changing so I never get bored. While I am not a veggie or vegan, I definitely respect that they have plenty of those options and they look so good on the menu, that I've ordered a few. One of my favorite things about this place is that if you're in a hurry, they offer delicious oatmeal and eggs in a cup to go...Don't forget the doughnuts!  The ONLY downfall about this place is that it's pretty small. Don't be alarmed by the size or the line that is probably running out the door during peak hours. It's totally worth the wait and they really move it along while maintaining their high level of customer service. Plus, the crowd is pretty great and you can make new friends with the crew or the customers in the intimate seating area. Bonus!",2,4/21/2011,0,0,0,40.7357789,-74.00725826

Ancolie,4.5,"This place looks like it came fresh out of Los Angeles - its hipster, cookie-cutter design (white brick walls, metal seating and wooden tables) is not creative, albeit, perhaps refreshing, and definitely instagram-worthy.  I came here on a Saturday morning with my boyfriend, the place was almost empty. The first thing you'll notice is that the portion to price ratio is extremely asymmetrical. You're getting maybe twelve ounces of food for 12 dollars. For example, they had carrots and leaves in a jar for $12 and pesto pasta (which you could easily make 10x the amount of at home for ~$10) also for $12. The prices are ridiculous, but I guess this is West Village and Ancolie caters to the white mom and/or vegan culture.  I grabbed a $4, 8oz jar of yogurt with mango and my boyfriend had a $6 jar of yogurt with granola (this wasn't even filled up all the way!!!). We also got a baguette with ham and cheese inside (another $6) and I ordered a cappuccino ($4). The total came out to around $22 with tax but luckily I had a voucher that allowed me to get $20 worth of food for only $10. That is the only reason I'd ever eat at this place.  The jar concept is fun, but I feel as though it's a misleading tactic to overprice your food and give you tiny portions. There are so many great yogurt/salad/acai places nearby, do not come here on an empty stomach - you will still leave hungry.  The baguette with ham and cheese was a joke. 1 star for this. They ""warmed"" it up but the cheese wasn't melty at all and the ham was average. You can get high-quality baguettes + ham/cheese like this in Europe for a single euro.  The mango yogurt I got was yummy, but tiny. The yogurt parfait my boyfriend ordered ($6) was sub-par and not worth it.  The only thing I could actually ever stomach paying $4 for is the cappuccino. It was good coffee and came well-presented. Another bonus is getting to keep the fun little jars that the food comes in afterwards to reuse. If you give it back, you get $1 discount on your next purchase. (I won't be coming back so I kept my jar).",2,4/14/2018,1,1,0,40.73324539,-73.99910375
Ancolie,4.5,"I popped into this place to kill some time and ordered a iced chai latte and a cold mint tea for my boyfriend. We had to cancel the mint tea order because only had hot tea and said it would take a while to cool it down (??). My iced chai was terrible. No flavor, watered down (I'm not sure how it got watered down so quickly) and it also had some of those milk specks in it from the milk jug (or maybe bits of sour milk?) It was also $6, super overpriced. The menu says there is a $2 jar deposit, so I thought, fine, I'll get $2 back when I return the jar. A $4 chai is totally normal. However, when I returned the jar, I was given the choice of a token to receive $2 off on my next visit or keeping the jar. This should be disclosed on the menu or by the cashier before a purchase is made. I knew I wouldn't be going back since my drink was so bad and I didn't really need the jar. I ended up taking the jar and leaving annoyed that I paid for a really terrible drink.",2,11/26/2018,1,0,0,40.73324539,-73.99910375

In stark contrast to the loud restaurants and bars on the rest of the block, Ancolie is where you take a break and enjoy a moment of peace.

Her grandmother's brownie is also delicious. I live down the street and have been going pretty frequently. I love the concept of not having waste when I get take out. The jars are so elegant and so easy to slip into my bag to go and I just use a silver fork when I get home - it's much more enjoyable.

Bel Ami,4,"Who can walk past a patisserie without stopping in?! We were working our way through town for the holiday weekend and spotted this cozy place. We just wanted a quick sweet bite so as to not fill up on our way to where we were going. I ordered a little baguette sandwich with mozzarella and sun dried tomatoes. The taste was great, but unfortunately they had heated it up in the paper so it was all stuck to the melted cheese and it was hard to peel off. I may have eaten some of it... The canele was good, if you aren't a fan of flan flavored things though they can taste a little eggy. This had a nice, mildly sweet taste. Last but not least, we had a blueberry mousse. I was worried it would be a case of too pretty to eat, but it was actually not bad. The first couple bites tasted like blueberry Philadelphia cream cheese but it grew on me. I couldn't quite pick out the coconut or pistachio, but the dessert definitely got better towards the end. The petals tasted like lucky charm marshmallows.

Black Fox Coffee,4,"I am sitting here with possibly the worst cup of coffee I have ever had in my life - and that includes the one I got at the truck stop in Kansas where I saw a guy in a ""Keep America White"" t-shirt eat 18 White Castle sliders in under five minutes. Never before have I felt so bitter (much like the taste of this coffee) about wasting six (!!!) dollars on a ""large"" almond milk latte (which is only 12 ounces because everyone knows that anything generous enough to make you happy is against the Hipster Code of Self-Imposed Ironic Deprivation and Ennui). I'd ask for my money back, but I don't think the baristas can hear me, as their heads seem to be inserted very far up into a place where the sun doesn't shine. Apparently instead of asking ""Do you have any cinnamon,"" which merited the blankest stare since Professor Lockhart got his memory wiped, I should have asked ""Do you know when the aliens are coming to wipe this pit of sadness and shame from the face of the earth"" - perhaps that at least may have given me a tiny sip (still probably larger than this coffee) of satisfaction.",2,7/15/2017,1,0,0,40.7065047,-74.0077715

Because the staff rotate between the 2 locations, sometimes it feels like the UWS centric staff picked up the UWS attitude and view our neighborhood as an annoyance...  Case and point, this location used to advertise that they're dog friendly. Then, a barista who moved to the UWS location told me that it's actually ""breaking the rules"" to allow dogs. I've been to this place before their bathroom opened! I was in this place when they had dogs welcomed stickers on their door! I was buying coffee here even before this person was hired!

Blue Stripes Cacao Shop,4.5,"I was honestly really disappointed with Blue Stripes, which is a pity since I live two minutes away and was hoping it would become one of my go-to caf̩s.  I came in for lunch to work a bit and ordered the avocado tartine with manchego. Along with a small Pellegrino, the total came to be over $18 once tip was involved. I realized that optional tip they recommended must have been including the tax, which bugged me since they didn't give you an estimate, just the percentage on the machine. It wasn't the end of the world, but just more expensive than I would have liked.  The avocado toast itself was great, though only a single piece of bread.  But what really bothered me was that about 45 minutes after I sat down, I was asked to put away my computer because the caf̩ was getting ""too crowded.""  This really frustrated me--because though I do dislike people who camp out for hours after buying a small coffee, I do feel like paying nearly $20 should have entitled me to at least an hour to work.  I also would have been more than happy to share my table with someone, but apparently that did not matter.  So, sure this place is cute and I might venture back to grab a chocolate treat and then go. But for anyone hoping for a lunch, know that I had really just wished I had gone to the Butcher's Daughter instead.

Clean, modern, and open they had several high top tables along the right side of the space, with one large table towards the front of the cafe perfect for working on your laptop, as well as comfortable chairs in the back for reading and/or working. It definitely seems like the ideal space for students from Parsons, the New School, or NYU to come and do work at.  The menu was also very diverse! An assortment of pastries and staple cafe foods allowed for you to satisfy your sweet tooth or to fill up on a savory snack. My friend and I just had a regular hot cup of coffee ($3.50) but I'd definitely go back to try a few different thinks on their menu.  Service was also fast and efficient.

They have good music, good light, plenty of seats, but the whole is more than the sum of its parts. This would be a good place to catch up with a friend or to read a good book.

Bluestone Lane,4.5,"I've had coffee here now three times, and I have just not been impressed.   I either drink an espresso, a cortado or a macchiato depending on the coffee shop, their ability to make said drinks, and the time of year (winter, fall, spring, summer, etc.) This place apparently does some sort of spin off of a ""flat white"" that they call a ""magic"".  When I order a cortado, I expect a cortado, a classic one, not a ""play"" on a flat white (per their website description).  Too much milk in it.  A cortado should have one or two shots of espresso and a small amount of steamed milk to cut the acidity. This magic drink seems to have way too much milk, so much so that it seems like I'm drinking a cappuccino.  Simply too long of a drink.  In short, if you're not going to serve classic cortados, your customers should know beforehand, not after they've paid almost $5.00 for a drink.  I also found whoever the person was straightening up this morning obnoxious.  I kept moving away from him because they had music blasting and he's humming all about right in peoples' ears.  After I got my drink and got an explanation as to what in the hell a ""magic"" was, then I had to wait for this same guy to clean up the coffee area.  How about you do that AFTER people finish with their coffee....  Here I am with my cortado waiting for him to finish cleaning up.

We decided to make this a go-to spot and came a few times after this but sadly each time, it kinda went downhill.  First, the restaurant gets kinda dirty, the seats aren't clean, lots of crumbs and lint. We had to ask for cutlery to be replaced as it was dirty and my latte had a small hair in it....so yuck....server replaced it but still charged me for it which was a bummer because I obviously couldn't enjoy the rest of my meal after that.  It's a small place so I get it's hard to clean while people are dining but it's a brand new place and already getting dingy. Their hours were also spotty, we called to see what time the kitchen closed and they said 530pm.....we rushed down to make it there by 510pm and they said they closed the kitchen early and we couldn't be served. When we explained that we called to make sure, they weren't apologetic or anything considering it was their mistake. Bummer. We won't be back.",2,3/13/2019,3,1,0,40.7836064,-73.9777007

Bluestone Lane,4,"I have been to this location multiple times, so feel it's time to write a fair review. It pains me to say this because I love some of their other locations, but AVOID, AVOID, AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I was so happy to have them in the neighborhood, as I love their avo smash and am used to traveling to the West Village for it. This location is an absolute sh**show. Honestly, one star is a generous rating. Not ONCE have I received adequate service there. The space itself is absolutely cramped- there is not one comfortable seat in the whole place; which, given the price of their items, is frankly unacceptable and reflects poorly on the greedy owners. I reluctantly went again this morning with a friend who wanted to try it and as per usual was quoted a wait time of 15 minutes that ended up being 30. The service here is always confusing (you don't have a server, you basically just have to wave down the nearest person who looks like they work there and hope they see you), but never as astonishingly bad as it was today. Our food came out an hour after ordering, and our server was nowhere to be found. Eventually, I got up and asked her to check on our food. She seemed irritated but said sure, and proceeded not to check on our food and not check in with us either. My friend ordered the rainbow bowl with salmon, and the salmon was inedibly raw. We sent it back, and asked that they not bring us out another salmon because we had already waited so long for the food. No apologies from her at all. 15 minutes later, she brought out another salmon despite our wishes. We had a good laugh but were not at all surprised when THIS salmon was raw as well- like what?! We sent it back yet again and requested it be taken off the bill- a VERY reasonable request considering it was inedible both times. Our server literally disappeared and so we finally packed up and went to the host to pay our bill. Surprise surprise, the salmon was not taken off of the bill. When I told the host who brought our bill about the ""atrociously bad service"" we received, he said ""I know, I know."" There were no discounts provided for us on our bill despite the horrible experience we had. I literally swear I will never, ever be back; and everyone I know who wants to go here will be warned.  OH, and to top it all off, my friend who consumed the salmon has FOOD POISONING. Jesus Christ.",2,11/30/2018,0,1,0,40.7836064,-73.9777007

I asked them to turn it down, but with all the people working, someone should have really had the sense to take initiative on that. Looking around, others were disturbed by the music volume too. It was truly unbearable. Again, I love the food but the experience left something to be desired.

This place, like most Australian brunch spots, is super aesthetic, colorful, modern and sleek. One thing you must note before coming here is that the space itself is tiny, like TINY. So be prepared to squeeze through the restaurant and bump into a few people. At first I didn't know this was a chain, so that's helpful to note as well. Also, due to the small size of the resto, wait times can be a bit long. So be prepared!  My friend and I both got flat whites. I ordered an avocado toast and added bacon and a poached egg to it.

Bluestone Lane Collective Cafe,4,"On a bitterly cold Thursday, we ventured to the Neue Museum on 5th Ave. - too early as it tuned out, so we (2 adults, 2 teen girls) looked for coffee and brekkie at 10am.  Happened on this amazing hole is wall of a church at E90th - and it was clearly sent from Aussie heaven.  We had the best coffees ever in our admittedly limited experience in NYC, and choked down on breakfast bowls of quinoa, tomatoes, avacadoes, feta.... as well as avocado smash on toast.  It was perfect.  The lovely and kooky Aussie servers were not perfect, but their attitude and exhuberance made up for it in abundance.  We will definitely return on our next trip.

Bluestone Lane Collective Cafe,4,"Let's start with the fact that Bluestone Lane was crowded on a Friday morning (everyone might have been hiding from the rain).  The indoor area was very cozy, but unfortunately it was full.  There was outdoor seating that was covered and under heaters so it wasn't too bad to sit there.  Ordered the Baked Green Eggs which was only okay and a latte which was good! What got this review to 4 stars though was definitely their service.  Even though my latte was forgotten at first, the server was very apologetic and made one right away.

Bluestone Lane Collective Cafe,4,"Bluestone lane has become my favorite brunch spot in west village this year. Came here on weekends in the past and there was always a wait, even on rainy days! But I stopped by with my boyfriend recently for a weekday brunch and it was very different from my previous visits.  We walked inside and there wasn't a hostess greeting us and someone told us to sit wherever we like. I am so used to coming on Sunday, putting down my name and waiting for a table haha. The only thing about weekdays is the back outdoor area being closed. Nonetheless, the cafe is still big enough with multiple sections open. We found an empty quiet spot and settled down with the menu.  The avocado toast here is always a hit but I decided to get something different this time. I had a flat white and the corn fritters. My boyfriend got a cucumber soda with the portobello mushroom toast. The corn fritters was stacked, with avocado smash in between, arugula, tomatoes and smoked salmon. And props for the generous portion of smoked salmon! The price is a little expensive but the food was very filling and I left with a happy tummy. The portobello mushroom is great as well but my boyfriend mentioned that he will probably not get it again and try something else next time. The avocado smash he ordered on the side was also not worth the $3.  Will continue to return during weekdays for the quiet and delicious brunch.",2,8/14/2015,0,0,0,40.7358109,-74.0009087

I went in for brunch alone two weeks ago and had two delicious ""entr̩e"" dishes, which costed my around $32. A while after I left, I got notifications from my band regarding my credit card transactions, as I always do. I was charged $32 for what I had, but then, immediately after, I was charged approx. an additional $45. I returned immediately as I assumed that it was a mistake. I talked to them, and they told me that they were too busy to figure that out immediately so they will call me within a day or two. So I waited for a few days, but they never called me. I went back again the following weekend and informed them about the problem again. They were very nice and apologetic, but told me, again, that they would call me within a day or two. I waited for another few days, but the call still never came. At this point, I do not even bother to try anymore.

The big menu board lists prices for beverages but they also sell a large assortment of foods.  Rather than play a guessing game or asking the employees for the price of each item I just left.

Boule & Cherie,3.5,"On the corner of Amsterdam and 68th of the restaurant and cafe wasteland that is midtown, there lies a small glimmer of hope that is Boule and Cherie. It's quite large and spacious for a cafe, especially when you compare it to nearby competitors such as Joe Coffee and Indie. Lots of seating, tables and even a couch with a relatively chill environment makes this a pretty good study and hang kind of place. There could stand to be a few more outlets but on a regular day it's not too bad to nab a spot that has easy access to one.  My personal preference here is stick to just the coffee, they use Stumptown (and even have their cold brew) are pretty good at their drip brew, not too shabby on their espresso based drinks, and the pricing isn't too bad either. The food could stand to have a bit of improvement; the pastries and quiche are okay but nothing to run home and celebrate about.  What you may run out and celebrate about is an actual space to relax, converse without yelling, and do some work without having to worry about prying eyes trying to steal your seat.",2,3/14/2016,0,0,0,40.7759409,-73.9839557
Breads Bakery,4,"Noticed Breads Bakery from across the street. Usually, go to a Pret A Manger or Starbucks. So, try new place this time.  As I walked in on a Saturday around 12:30 pm there were lots of people. Searched for something to snack on like a salad or sandwich. There were more baked items in display cases as you enter and at the counter further up. Saw Babka, honey cake, croissants, etc... Found area where they had salads and prepared meals. Went for the Salmon with cream cheese on Sourdough bread.  The line was confusing. I got on the line. Some people got off cause they were looking around. I came up to counter. Staff said that all you getting. I said I also wanted a large Cappuccino. Staff directed me to go to other end. Saw another staff making coffee. I stood on that line. One customer said she did not know where line was. By the time, I went to place order, the staff making coffee said I have to pay first. I told her staff mate at counter said go where you are. At least, I gave her the order. Then, I went to another line to pay.  Couple of things 1) Once they rang up order. The computer ask if you want to add tip. You gotta be kidding. I did self servIce. No need to tip. I went on three different lines.  2) I had to ask for bag.  3) The cashier asked what kind of milk after I had placed the order.  After paying for everything, got back online for the Cappuccino. The staff made coffee for someone else. I was happy I was out of this place. What an ordeal just to get two items.  Found their baked item to be tad expensive. You can get Babka elsewhere. Cappuccino can get at any other store.",2,9/9/2018,16,9,10,40.7710295,-73.9818079

Breads Bakery,4,"Just thinking about this place takes me back to the smell of fresh sweet doughy babka floating in the air, punching your senses as you walk in, begging you for a bite of the Russian baked creation. I want to jump on the train and get some right now! Walking around Lincoln center with some time to kill, I wanted to explore a good bakery with some fresh baked pastries and good cup of cappuccino. A quick look on the yelp app, and bingo!, I found Breads bakery just a few blocks up. I called my brother to see if he would like to grab a cup of coffee, and as soon as he heard where I was headed, he jumped on the bus across central park to meet me. His exact words were ""Get the babka, and an extra for me to take home."" Apparently he's been to one near Union Square. Breads bakery was a great experience from start to finish. I ordered a tuna sandwich as my lunch and sat outside to enjoy it while people watching. The sandwiches are fresh and delicious. I would say slightly pricey, but I am dining on the upper west side near Lincoln center, so $8 for a small tuna sandwich is pretty competitive to the area. I do believe that they use Italian tuna, which isn't that bumble bee kind you find at CVS always on sale. No offense Bumble Bee tuna, chicken of the sea is better. The staff was truly very kind and even passed around bites as a taster of their product. The parmesan cookies were nice, banana bread was good, and of course the babka was amazing. I prefer the Chocolate one, and the best part is that they give you a discount if you purchase 2. We sat outside with a warmed up babka, we asked, on a wooden board, with a steak knife, ready to devour. Sweet babka with a great brewed coffee really made my day. I even took one to my boss and he absolutely loved it. I look forward to trying some of their other pastries, specifically, the chocolate mousse puff for two, its next on my list.

I kinda expected mediocre quality, but I was pleasantly surprised. The creme brulee croissant is rather a misnomer. I thought it is better called creme custard croissant since there was no burnt cream (caramelized sugar) on top of mine. It wasn't to sweet, and tasted fresh even at 11pm. The almond croissant was a little sad looking, being squashed down to the pancake level. I thought it could use a little more fragipagne filling and a little less sugar.

Breads Bakery,4,"First of all, let me say I absolutely LOVE most of my breads and desserts from Breads despite the high price.  However, when I'm paying a relative higher price for a delicious premium product, I expect the service to match to the standard. I come here at least a couple times a week, and I have to say almost every other time I come across a different staff with a surprisingly snobbish attitude...and I'm talking about an attitude before you even start talking to them...  A few weeks ago I had to wait like 15min for a chocolate because the guy was just so busy talking to another staff about random personal things. When I kindly asked where's my order he just looked confused and didn't say anything, went back to making the chocolate while talking to the other person...  This week I went in and asked a question two times before purchase but the cashier lady did not give me a straight answer and didn't care to elaborate when I asked her the second time (dah...I asked twice because I didn't get my answer the first time! I was not looking for a repeat!) Plus she just stared at me with her head tilted...and later she got into an argument with another customer at the counter for not lining up...I'm in no ways encouraging cutting lines but things like this create a very bad experience for fellow customers.  I hope this can bring some attention to the management...train your staff, monitor what happens, or, please visit some other premium bakeries in NYC and see for yourselves what kind of service is NYC standard...you probably get away with the attitudes because of the neighborhood/clientele but I believe I'm not the only one.

Just telling me sunchoke and cheese would have been fine, I didn't ask for the details or indicate any sort of food allergy, but more importantly, I didn't need to feel like I was putting him out for asking.  Either way, I'll be back! Certainly for this Passover quiche over the next few days, and then for more delicious treats in the future!",2,4/14/2017,0,0,0,40.7710295,-73.9818079

If you want to plugin for work, you'll need luck. The place is simple but it does the job. The thing missing is more power outlets. If you're lucky to get a table by a power outlet, you'll quick find out that some of them don't work, so you'll be limited to whatever battery you have left on your devices.  I ordered a mocha and it was surprisingly good, one can taste the properly roasted beans in there and good quality soy milk.  We sat at the bar by the window, where working becomes a challenge, not because of the power outlets or the space at the bar...

But then I discovered something I could have. LATTES WITH ALMOND MILK AND HONEY.  And so that's what I've been getting everywhere. And this is like the best one ever.  City of Saints's espresso is sooooo fragrant, when you drink it, the smell just lives in your mouth/nose/nasal cavity (hahaha, if you try it you'll understand what I mean!). I've forgotten that I'm not drinking a vanilla latte with whole milk.  The baristas carefully measure out and press the espresso. They have manual espresso machines, so they weigh the espresso themselves on a scale as it comes out and they stop it right at the perfect weight. Then they add the honey/whatever you're adding into the espresso. I have discovered that 15g of honey is the perfect amount for my almond latte. :D  My boyfriend got the lavender agave (which I think was seasonal. Homemade agave syrup with lavender pressed into it or something?) and he let me have a tiny sip even though I'm on a diet. Tastes similar to Bibble & Sip's lavender latte.  Also, if you plan on coming back for more wonderfulness, make sure you go through all of the pay screen and after you press no receipt, you'll get stars to get $3 off your 10th purchase or whatever. :( I've literally gone there every weekday since I discovered it last Thursday. I bought 1 drink on Thurs 10/4, 2 on Fri 10/5, and 2 on Mon 10/10, but didn't think about asking until yesterday, so after today, I only have 2 stars, instead of 7 :(((((.)

Their metal countertops - though spacious - heat up so quickly under the sun that it's practically impossible to touch. (Lots of natural light though, which is a plus.)

Super chill with a lot of unique options between their various salads, sandwiches, and all day (gasp!) breakfast items. The wifi is free and it almost feels like a cool little den to work in, but lit nicely by outdoor sunlight from the glass storefront.  Love love love the sandwiches here...tried the Turkey Club ($11) which had a combination of avocados, olives, and pickles (all things i find necessary in a truly good sandwich) and was so large, I had trouble taking it down and ended up being lame and resorting to a fork and knife method.  The breakfast frittata (which is actually an egg sandwich) is also quite good and tastes like a complete meal, warm and fresh out of the square egg-steaming-mould.  Tried the Peruvian Pudding (quinoa soaked in almond milk, honey, and topped with berries) which was less of a dessert and more of a cold oatmeal replacement.  For some reason, everything here comes packaged for take-out. Convenient, and sends the WE'RE NOT HERE TO INSTAGRAM- WE'RE HERE TO WURKKK message.

The spicy hot chocolate (made with Valrhona chocolate) had a nice kick to it without the spice being overpowering.

Handcraft Coffee,4,"this place is so lame. it's a pretend 'artisanal' coffee shop with truly terrible coffee and an employee dress code that mandates fedoras. try finding out where the coffee beans are roasted - you won't see any sort of indication or signage, because it's probably cheap bulk coffee. it certainly tastes like it. the location is right next to the subway entrance so it gets much more business than it deserves, but do yourself a favor and walk two blocks south to joe, or three blocks east to oslo, if you want decent coffee in the area.  bottom line: handcraft does a disservice to small businesses that actually try hard to put out a good product (and don't require their employees to wear fedoras), and it does a disservice to the neighborhood, which deserves better. they've taken us for fools. hard pass.",2,8/12/2017,0,0,0,40.77359942,-73.959483

Hutch & Waldo,4.5,"Came here for Sunday brunch and it was PACKED. The place is tiny with only a few tables, so expect a wait if you want to sit down! I got a cold brew which was fine, but their paper straws disintegrate within five minutes. I'm all for being environmentally friendly but I've had way nicer paper straws at other places and they really need to switch brands!  For my main, I ordered the Morning Greens, which was supposed to have kale, quinoa, tomatoes, goat cheese, sunflower seeds, fried egg and lemon. It took probably 20 minutes for it to come out and when it did there was no quinoa on it. We went back up and were given a little cup of it, but it would've been better had it been mixed in to begin with. It was very average. Nothing special about the dish at all.  My main issue, though, is the price. The cold brew was $6 which is seriously ridiculous. I was also charged an extra $3 for an extra egg because the guy originally thought I asked for it - I clarified literally three times that I only wanted one egg, nothing extra, but clearly he didn't understand that. I didn't realize I was charged for it until after and didn't feel like causing a fuss. So, the total was $21 which seems insane for what I got.",2,4/15/2019,1,0,1,40.7748634,-73.9542247
Hutch & Waldo,4.5,"Very cool place. Parlor espresso, which is fantastic. Great music and atmosphere. Servers were very nice. My cortado was outstanding.  The cold brew here is idiotic however, it is the most expensive in the city and doesn't taste good. They say they do it for 48 hours which is about three times as long as anybody else. That's fine, but longer doesn't necessarily mean better, end it isn't better, it's worse. It's kind of like kyoto style in flavor, but too much. It's also kind of like Starbucks back in the day: way too strong, and begging for milk or sugar. And that is six dollars for an average size portion.

Hutch & Waldo,4.5,"In distant memory Yorkville residents can hear the boom of controlled explosions from the birthing of the Second Avenue Subway. Now, we experience the excellent small business boom that's followed, hoping for shops like Hutch & Waldo whose staff are Upper East Side proud. Imagine the best of the beverages from downtown and Brooklyn coffee shops without the ""too cool"" hipster attitude. Hutch & Waldo is slinging Parlor beans which in my opinion, are some of the best you can serve in the New York City area. In addition to bringing new beans to the area, they also have a variety of milks from hemp to coconut which is rare uptown beyond Starbucks. Even though the caf̩ is small with only 6 bar stools, the vibe is still warm and welcoming. This is the sort of spot you can grow to call your own and keep casual conversation with the baristas.

But this time they changed the policy where you have to buy either the special drink or two selected drinks from the menu in order to get the cup holder and photo card, items that aren't even provided by the shop itself but by fans. You're already profiting off of fans who come here to buy drinks but to make it limited to certain drinks that are more pricey is not fair. The special Hoseok drink is nearly $7 and consists of pineapple, apple and some sort of soda. That's ridiculous. People come here out of pure love and joy for our boys.

Intelligentsia Coffee,4,"We stopped by here after our brunch in the neighborhood yesterday. I never knew there was a High Line Hotel, so the big plastic banner (not even a sign) outside saying ""Intelligentsia Coffee in High Line Hotel"" did help!  Intelligentsia Coffee is located inside the small lobby of the High Line Hotel. I have to say the d̩cor (of the lobby) is a bit odd and outdated -- only the smell of new paint indicates that it is a ""new"" place.  The baristas were very friendly. The coffee was good. I liked my Mocha ($5). My husband ordered a pour-over of its decaf blend ($4). It came with one mug of coffee and one small glass jar of refill, and the mug and the jar were served in a tray. It looked very sophisticated. I also drank some of his coffee, and it seemed to be the kind with high acidity. I noticed that they served croissants from Bien Cuit.  The seating was limited and only in the lobby area. There was also a small bar for standing. A lot of people dropped in, took a look, and left, probably due to the lack of seating. The good news is that we heard the barista telling another customer that they would open the garden (located behind the lobby) soon.  Overall, it was a pleasant experience.

Irving Farm New York,3.5,"I love the convenience of having a solid sit-down coffee place around my office but there are some aspects of this place that leave me a bit cold.  First, each time I step inside, I'm always hit with the desire to give everything a solid scrub-down. Floors are sticky; tables have small spills and leftover wrappers. I don't want to come off as the health inspector and I don't mind eating dumplings in a dingy Chinatown room but for a cafe where you want to catch up or read a book, ambiance matters a little to me.  Second, on the few times I've been here, the baristas tend to treat the line like herding cattle. I understand that kind of attitude in Starbucks, where you need to keep the line and the flow of orders going or you'll be swamped, but, in the late afternoon, with maybe one or two people in line, there's absolutely no need to beckon impatiently and roll your eyes.  Also, when I took a sip and realized that my latte contained regular milk rather than almond milk, the barista doubled down and absolutely insisted that I hadn't specifically requested for almond milk. Maybe I caught her on a bad day but the barista more or less flipped out and started banging things to show her displeasure at having to remake the drink. At that point, I would have preferred to just scrabble out of there with the wrong drink in hand. It was very strange.  Two points for the amazing goat cheese and honey toast - the combination initially weirded me out but I changed my mind at the first bite.",2,1/10/2018,10,4,4,40.7563814,-73.971662

However, I was very disappointed with my drink and the transaction process. I paid with my credit card and as the barista moved to return my credit card, I reached out to take it from her, but instead she just slapped it on the counter. That was so weird. Is it a cultural thing?  On to the drink. She prepared my shots of espresso and once they'd finished, she went to get the milk, then came back to stream it. The shots sat for a couple minutes before she added the milk. The result was a very bitter flat white. And the dairy tasted like butter, but not in a pleasant way.

Well, maybe that's a old statement.  Let's just say it's very good. If it was located in some obscure downtown location then their owners would probably be opening up second and third locations.  The coffee is rich and one can choose from a variety of different types. It's self-serve, which I also prefer. A cup of coffee should be drawn from the drinker. More specialty coffee and tea drinks can be made by some trained college student/barista but if it's just coffee, then I can do it myself.  It's a little small but not as crowded as one would imagine. There are usually a few people working on their screenplays and a table for light conversation; it straddles work/study and date house.  There is also a few comfortable chairs outside for warm weather seating.

Rude: when I finally picked up my drink, I expected her to apologize for the wait.

Joe Coffee Company,4,My favorite cup o joe in manhattan was at Joe's. I went to a few of their locations and was impressed by their quality and consistency. They lattes and coffee are perfect. I would say better than blue bottle and rivaling stumptown.  Their locations are all very tiny with enough space to comfortably seat 10 ppl. They have no wifi. And they sell doughnut plant donuts.

Kahve,4,I came here to have a nice brunch with my friends because the reviews praised the food. Well I can't speak for the rest of the food but I had the traditional avocado toast with arugula and the iced vanilla mint latte. The avocado toast was terrible. I think it was the lemon juice (maybe vinegar) but it was sooo sour. And it smelled strange. I tried a couple bites but I couldn't stomach it. The latte was alright but not worth the hype. It was a little too bitter and I couldn't taste the mint or vanilla- just tasted like a plain latte. For a total of $16 it was definitely not worth it. And there's not much seating either. The only reason that I gave 2 stars is because of the presentation. If only it tasted as good as it looked.,2,12/22/2017,0,0,0,40.762817,-73.993499
Kahve,4,"One of my favorite coffee joints in manhattan. It's a tiny/narrow coffee spot in Hell's Kitchen. I love the bright pink which makes it super easy to spot from the curb side. I am a big fan of matcha and I find it really difficult to find this in the city without sugar. Kahve is one of the few spots that actually serves matcha correctly. I usually order that either in latte form or iced (in the summer). They do a great job. I also had a lemonade from them in the summer (basil) and they actually blend pieces of basil into the drink and it's so refreshing and delicious! I would recommend that for the summer months. The cookies are also very good, chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin, both delicious. The atmosphere is extremely welcoming inside, a great little place to read a book or catch up on some work.

Knave,3.5,"I've always liked this place in spite of the $30 glasses of bad wine.  It used to be dark and sexy, the service was classy and attentive.  The last couple of times we've come here, it's cold, careless and sad.  It feels as though it's under new management and the clientele has morphed into loud, tacky tourists.  We arrived both times and there was nowhere to sit.  The last time we were there a couple of weeks ago, we ended up sitting on the far end near the outside door.  It took nearly ten minutes for a server to greet us and when she did, she was short with us and when we tried to order food with our drinks she looked annoyed and let us know it would be 15 minutes before food would arrive.  Uh....why?  She also told us she would be leaving and another server would take over our order.  A better table popped up near the other side of the bar, so we moved there.  We let the new server know and 15 minutes passed.  In desperation, my husband walked to the bar to check on our drinks as our server was nowhere to be found.  Mind you...the original server was STILL there.  She admonished my husband for not waiting for her to arrive with the drinks.  At that point, we kind of gave up.  Her attitude was terrible.  The manager arrived and apologized and said she would take the drinks off of our bill. The one bright light was that the drinks were actually pretty good (not wine).  Alas the bill arrived and the drinks were still on the check.  They had removed the much less expensive food items.  Nice.  Not sure I'll go back.",2,11/6/2017,4,3,3,40.7643945,-73.97839027

Knave,3.5,"Prior to attending a matinee at City Center, I decided to treat myself. Knowing this place's reputation for both good cocktails and high end espresso, figured I'd get a proper, traditional Irish Coffee served in a nice tall glass with a layer of heavy cream on top. To my great disappointment, I was served an oversized regular (and mediocre for that matter) cup of coffee with no cream, and a cordial of whiskey/Bailey's on the side. Didn't taste right at all, and was certainly not the experience anyone is looking for when ordering this drink. I'd keep my lips tight regarding this matter if not for the fact that, not including tip, the charge for this cheaply executed and disappointing drink came out to a ridiculous $22 and change. When I brought this matter up with the staff, who were thoroughly gracious, they informed me that they are aware of this issue but that management has instructed them to serve this drink this way and that they will not listen to them. Therefore, I'm hoping that management will listen to me here when I say you shouldn't assume that you know better than what the public wants. Would give one star if not for the fact I don't want the workers to receive much in the way of flack. You can't fault folks for doing what they've been told. However, they have been told wrong, and until you start serving proper drinks that are in line with atmosphere you market, and steep prices you charge, I will not be returning and will urge others to stay away.",2,2/21/2016,0,0,0,40.7643945,-73.97839027

Finally condescended to deliver my check, but after about 15 minutes of trying to get his attention, gave up and walked it to the bar myself.

Knave,3.5,"My present condition has led me to keep coming back to Knave as a coffeeshop and nothing more.  However I have to mention, that their coffees are top notch. They brew a counter culture blend, and the whole range of espresso based drinks are simply delightful, topped with the simplest of latte arts. What truly won my heart over though, was the hot chocolate - it is served as in no other place. A generous cup filled up to the one-third mark with a rich chocolate fudgey truffley sauce, into which you pour warm and generously foamed milk, just as much as you desire.  The service can sometimes be a bit slow, but it only makes me spend more time at this lovely lounge, and that in general makes me happier about life. The tall ceilings are beautifully painted. The large mirrors on either side are shyly covered with velvet drapes. The chandeliers complete the old world charm they're going for. And they're always playing either a lovely jazz piece, or a carribbean tune. I wonder who created that mix.  It just makes me regret each time I used this section of the hotel as a mere trespasser crossing over to 56th street. This is right in my hood and I find myself here very often now, sipping on some of that truly delicious hot chocolate.  (P.S.

Knave,3.5,"It's inside one of what I consider New York's iconic hotels in an iconic part of the city. Due to it's proximity to Carnegie Hall and upscale stores, you will always find a respectful and quiet crowd here.  Thus it's perfect for a cozy conversation with your significant other.  If you are in a group, you can always try to squeeze into a booth at the Burger Joint nearby.  I just wanted the tea (they had Earl Grey, English Breakfast, and Peppermint when I went) and they served it up in an a manner that I hadn't seen before.  The tea leaves are rough cut in a pitcher and you put a sieve over  your drinking cup to catch the leaves.  The smaller ones inexplicably fall through which you try like hell to avoid swallowing, but the unique setup (at least for me) was charming.  I also had the chicken pesto sandwich which was small, but edible.  I would suggest you skip any of the panini options when decent burgers and fries are only a few yards away.  The reason this is a 4 star review however, is the decor and the furniture they provide for  you to sit in.  The benches and chairs are very plush and comfortable.

So the $6 mocha mentioned in the review was delicious, used a better-than-normal type of chocolate, and had impeccably executed latte art.  The 5th star is missing because sitting in a major subway-like thoroughfare in a place that's supposed to be fancy / cozy just undoes the effect for me, even if Bach's six suites for cello are playing in the background.

The scrambled eggs in the sandwich were sad and soggy...my sandwich literally dripped the entire time I was eating it. The only redeeming part about the sandwich was the cheese. It was nice and sharp and added great flavor. Otherwise the sandwich was a disappointment overall.

Le Reveil Coffee,4,"I really wanted to like this place. As a frequent NYC restauranteur, I had a pretty bad experience.  1) The menu is not clear. The breakfast/lunch menu is not very clear to what they offer. Good luck trying to customise.  2) The price is outrageous. I paid $14 for a bland egg-white sandwich, a cup of coffee and a smaller-than-average almond crossant. Breakfast shouldn't cost more than $10.  3) Owner acted pretentious. Anywhere you get breakfast in the city, there should be the basics like having ketchup. I asked politely for ketchup to the owner, and he replied ""No ketchup, sorry"" with a dismissive tone. I had to eat a bland egg-white sandwich now with salad (who TF serves salad with an egg sandwich???)  The ONLY redeeming quality would be the baguette and crossant were actually soft and well baked.

I love their Latte, Cappuccino, Iced Coffee (and if you heard from someone that they have ice coffee cubes - I can confirm that it is 100% true!!!). There is a lot of place to sit inside as they expanded the coffee shop recently and now they expanding the menu too and adding more food to it as well as wine (I guess now I will have to go there more often). Last time I went there I ordered habanera chicken salad while my friend had an avocado tuna salad. The portion of my chicken salad was good, enough to make you full but not too full, chicken was seasoned perfectly not overly spicy, but it had heat to it. Tomatoes, mushrooms, and peppers were a nice touch to salad and completed the whole dish. My friends' salad was an elevated version of peoples favorite tuna salad. I didn't eat the whole but I've tried and I can say it was good so as my friend. It was not too heavy, although it had mayo in it. And avocado cup in which the salad was served made the simple dish looking more interesting. Definitely going to steal this idea for my own recipe book. Overall as I said it an excellent place to go grab coffee or pastry, and now it is a place where you can go have lunch or dinner with a glass of wine.

The sandwich choices were unique considering the other options in the area, and for the most part it's affordable. I got the prosciutto sandwich sans olive tapenade and it was great! It's lovely to be able to select from their fresh breads...although the croissant was a bit too light for the contents of the sandwich, it's buttery flakiness was the perfect compliment! This sandwich got me coming back and I accidentally forgot to ask for no tapenade--completely changes the sandwich. I'm really not a fan, but I do feel that even if you were it overpowers the other ingredients of the sandwich, so avoid it!  As for their other offerings, my co-worker raves about the espresso, and their macarons are provided by Macarons and Cookies by Woops and aren't half bad.

For example, they have frequently skimped on the feta or left out the bread. This has happened far too often to be mere employee spaciness.

Dazzled but the chocolate in the store, I was excited for this epic cup I was about to drink. No exaggeration, the cup was the size of a double shot glass and that was $6.50. For such a price and small serving, surely this hot chocolate would be delicious. Wrong. Somehow the chocolate was bitter and solid.

I came here specifically with hot chocolate in mind on one of the subzero days we had in NYC recently. I wanted to get it to go but they have several cute little cafe tables in the back. There were several hot chocolate options in dark chocolate, milk, and while chocolate. I decided on the Aztec which is on of their dark chocolate choices. You can get a small, which is only about 2 or 3 oz or a large which is about 7 or 8 oz. The small is $5 and the large is $7.50 so you're much better off just getting the large.  The hot chocolate was ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. It was so rich and creamy and full of flavor. It is hands down one of the best hot chocolates I have had in the city. I can't recommend this enough. I will absolutely be coming back with the plan of getting a few of the other flavors in the small size so I can do a bit of a DIY hot chocolate sampling with my husband when he gets back from helping restore power in Puerto Rico!

MarieBelle,4,"Just finished having 3 delicious hot chocolates, one large white chocolate with Tahitian vanilla, and two cups of small milk chocolate. Totally divine.  What ruined a usual great experience was the behavior of their immature and pushy store associate behind the register named Inbar. I had brought forth two boxes of their clusters that I believed to be $7 each. They were tiny boxes so it was a safe assumption. When she scanned them, I had already given her my credit card, as I was sure it would be $14-20 at most. When she said it was $37, as in $17 each plus tax, I wasn't even afforded a slight moment of thought before she completed the transaction and gave me the receipt. Whilst standing there, I, of course was having second thoughts and figured I could exchange them for something else that I was looking at (their dual tins for $29). Keep in mind, I was still in the store, I hadn't moved from my previous spot. When telling her I wanted to at least exchange them for some other item, she nastily replied that she can't help me, no matter what the circumstances were. No refund, no exchange, nothing. I was with my family who were looking to shop afterwards, so I didn't want to bring it up with a manager and make a huge ordeal of it. But I'll definitely be contacting their general manager and disputing the charges. I love their shop for hot beverages, but I would never buy one of their products ever again. That nasty woman treated me as if I had taken the box outside and rummaged through them. I hadn't even moved from the register!",2,1/1/2016,5,0,1,40.72321077,-74.00245063
MarieBelle,4,Hot chocolate and chocolates were good but the three pastries I took home all tasted stale. It was either old or wasn't wrapped properly while it was in the fridge. I can definitely taste the fridge taste.,2,3/16/2016,0,0,0,40.72321077,-74.00245063
MarieBelle,4,"Their chocolates are very good, but they're more on the expensive side. They're very creamy, with subtle flavors of ginger or basil or cardamom, etc. which I really enjoy. I still think they are up there with some of the best chocolates I've had. And the patterns on the chocolates are fun. The shop itself is reminds me of Versailles because it's very opulent. I like it a lot. In the back they have a little salon and a display case of chocolate mousse and mango mousse pastries, etc. I've tried at least 4 of the varieties they had at the time and they were delicious. I like them better than the ones at Maison Kayser. However, I do not think they have the best hot chocolate, as they advertise. I think I got the milk hot chocolate with cinnamon stick and nutmeg, but I can't be sure. I thought it was overly sweet. I liked the waiter, he was very friendly and came around a few times to offer me little tastings of a few of their hot chocolate flavors. Like I said, I think all of them were overly sweet for my taste. I still think the best hot chocolate is at LA Burdick or City Bakery because both of those have a deep richness to them and they're not overly sweet. I also got the quiche and I do not recommend that because it did not have enough of the egg filling and tasted dry and bready. If you go here, I suggest sticking with their pastries and their chocolates, both of which you can take to go. They packaged up 4 pastries very nicely for me, which I appreciated.",2,1/27/2011,4,0,1,40.72321077,-74.00245063

All of this boutique's artisinal chocolates are exquisitely presented (box sets have pretty embossed ribbons!) and are all quality 60-72% single origin chocolates.  Tenka.com had a free trio of chocolates, which included the truffle, ganache, and champagne heart. The champagne heart is absolutely spectacular. I also bought the Dark Chocolate Obsession Rose tea (the pretty tin in the photo), and I am so not used to salivating over teas.  Mariebelle is also supposed to have the most ridiculous Aztec hot chocolate (though City Bakery's Hot Chocolat Festival is having some wear and tear on my body).

MarieBelle,4,"It was a rainy day. I was in New York. Walking in the Rain. Classic Buildings. Beautiful Moment.  Totally felt like in the old movies. What comes up in my mind? Yes, that thought of doing ""Singing in the Rain"" thing did come up, ain't going to lie about that.  I was so drenched in the rain and the umbrella my twin bought was crap, it went all the way up after half an hour. It was a rainy thursday night, and it seemed it would go all night. Right at our doorstep is Maribelle. I do believe in love at first sight, and yes I thought it was fate, it brought us together. Maybe I'm being silly, I felt the butterflies in stomach, it was so beautiful the moment I walked in. The store is so unique and had all these differnet kind of chocolates and its varities.  I went straight to the back where it has little coffee shop. Forget Serendipity, I've found love. I sat down and they welcomed me with warmness. Maybe it's me, I brought them prosperity. I was the first customer at that time I came in, and three of four others followed. I had the hot chocolate with a hint of espresso in it. They asked, what kind of coffee do you do, and I responded, Coffee is my family business, I take it strong and black, no weak American coffee. They read my mind like a book and initiated the Italians. You know it's true love when ones can read each other mind, no words exchanged.  The Cup of hot chocolate was perfect. It was so think and concentrated, it tasted exactly like a dark choclate metled into my cup, with strong coffee sense in it. It was just like I imagined it. Thick, Strong, and Dark. The hot chocolate cake is the icing of everything, it's a must, I say. I cant' describe the word of it, just pure heaven. Thank me later.  Bare in mind, this place isn't a local starbucks or other shops, they can be pricey, but toally worthed it. You pay for what you get, I mean it. My bill came out way more than I expected, but hey Love don't cost a thing.  I'll give up another second just to be with Maribelle again..",2,10/4/2007,5,4,3,40.72321077,-74.00245063
MarieBelle,4,"I hate to be the voice of dissent here, but I think that MarieBelle is way over rated.  I bought a bunch of chocolates here after a good friend (who live in Chelsea and buys gifts here a lot) recommended it.  I give this place a big, resounding ""Meh.""  The packaging is cute and the store itself attractive.  Even the chocolates are pretty.  But I think that the flavoring is too subtle or too much but rarely just right.  Their mojito chocolates are too much and I could not taste any real flavor in either the cardamom or the spicy varities.  I am all for subtle flavoring and have a refined enough palette but I just find their chocolates bland and slightly chalky.  The only reason I am giving them 3 stars is because I think that their caramels are fantastic.",2,4/21/2008,1,0,1,40.72321077,-74.00245063
MarieBelle,4,"A charming Tiffany box of a chocolate shop that whisks you off to a magical Paris where the people are nice and there's no need to mangle their language. Pass by the glass vitrine filled with elegant painted truffles and the lavishly wrapped bars of single-origin chocolate, decorated with hand-glittered pinup girls and settle in to the tiny cafe hidden in back to extend your vacation over savory crepes and tea, or warm peanut butter cookies and liquid drinking chocolate. Thick European hot chocolate is offered in several varieties each of Dark, Milk and White. it's far too pretty a place to make full-throated Homer Simpson-esque gurgles of joy as you taste the thick, rich, creamy chocolate, but  a few small gasps are unavoidable.

You have the choice of either the thicker European style (made with water) or still thick but not as thick as the European style, American style (made with milk). Whichever you choose you'll soon realize why their hot chocolate is served with a spoon and a glass of water.

One man came in and commented on the level of noise and one of the workers just replied, ""it's a free show,"" which annoyed me because there's a place to hang out and there's a place to work.

Ninth Street Espresso,4,"9th street espresso is a reliable, serious, back-to-the-basics coffee shop. No fancy coffee & milk based creations: the menu can be divided quite simply into three parts, espresso, espresso w/milk & (iced) coffee.  Although this might seem spare, perhaps *too* minimalist, 9th st espresso is a safe heaven for coffee purists who want to take a break from the sometimes exhausting (and increasingly complicated) world of coffee.  What they do here, they do it well. Their espresso w/milk (a latte) might not be the absolute best of its kind. It lacks complexity perhaps - its more bitter and distinctive than the drinks they serve in East village hangouts Bluebird, Gasoline Alley & City of Saints but it doesn't shine through like Stumptown, Abra̤ao or Intelligentsia. I noticed however that it is very caffeine intensive.  For this particular expansion of 9th st, location is KEY. Midtown's coffee scene is seriously lacking and, as a result, 9th st easily takes the crown of best coffee shop around.",2,4/8/2015,0,0,0,40.7608714,-73.9706595

They didn't serve bagels or created sandwiches; they had only croissants, huge donuts and sweet buns.  I was next on the line and very excited; I was in a good mood. I guess my excitement was a turn-off. I was met with such a nasty attitude from the barista. He was like ""what do you want?"" in such a tense manner, I was ready to pull the stick out of his behind. I requested a croissant and a decaf espresso and placed my Fiji water on the counter. The other barista was like ""well, how do you want it?"" in such a stank voice. My response was firm but full of attitude, ""I will take just take a shot of it"".  My smile was totally gone by the time I paid.

You would've thought the cafe was filled with a happy aura because of the cool music and the edible-looking pastries but nah. I wasn't impressed with the customer service. They were so rude.

Pink Moose,4.5,"Well, after reading reviews I really wanted to try this place that is pretty close to my home. The truth is the food is indeed very good, so the stars are for the food. Kale Berry salad was amazing and main course was very good. I enjoyed the house white wine but portion was not a standard, it was tasting portion. It was literally two sips. My husband had Bordo red and the portion was tiny again. So weird. Usually it is pretty standard. They brought salad for appetizer, then immediately they brought entry for my husband and like 20 minutes later my entry. You cannot bring entry 30 minutes apart, my husband ate because he did not want to get food cold. I ordered turkey and waitress clearly said that it has veggies and rice or potatoes. I said it is fine. When I got food, rice had beef or pork or lamb... basically red meat that I do not eat. You MUST tell a person that food has beef inside. I am ok with any veggies but having red meat is not acceptable. I was very disappointed because it is not what I eat, so my husband ate it. Then they removed plates and brought check. Seriously? They never asked if we want another wine, or dessert, coffee, etc. It was more than 1 hour before closing, so clearly that was not an issue. We decided not to ask for another wine/coffee or dessert, we just left. So food was good but they way they served it and the whole experience was pretty disappointing.

Pink Moose,4.5,"I rarely write reviews, but this spot is worth me taking the time... Pink Moose is incredible. It has a charming, cool atmosphere, great service, and an INCREDIBLE menu. It has all the trappings of a charming 90s sitcom-coffee shop/hang out - all that missing is a vintage couch:) I've always wanted to have a go-to spot in my neighborhood and I finally got it when Pink Moose opened. Now I  eat here all the time but also stop in for coffee and am never disappointed. The gluten free spaghetti is AMAZING, but so are their salads and roast chicken. Each dish is prepared from scratch, so it takes a little bit longer to prepare, but it's sooo worth the wait. It's like eating the most delicious home-cooking ever.  This is a fantastic spot  to meet a friend for coffee or brunch/lunch, wine or dinner and also a great spot to study or read by yourself with the tastiest coffee in the city (they actually roast the coffee themselves which is rare to find). They also make their own almond milk and make delicious matcha lattes.  Honestly I can't give them enough praise and love having them in my neighborhood as there is nothing else like it up here.  This local spot is a treasure but I'm not sure many people realize how amazing it is as it's fairly new. If you live  nearby you HAVE to check them out - you'll be glad you did and it will become one of your local favorites too:)",2,7/25/2017,2,0,1,40.7590592,-73.9620217

Prodigy Coffee,4,"We chose Prodigy over Bluestone Lane, which turned out to be a mistake. While the decor and vibe are reminiscent of your run of the mill nice coffee shop, the drinks left MUCH more to be desired.  I ordered an iced mocha, which was decent, save a few sugary chunks. My girlfriend ordered an iced dirty chai, which is what prompted me to write this review. The drink had a sour taste akin to curdled milk, unlike any other dirty chai I've tasted before. To quote my girlfriend, ""I have no idea how they could serve this.""    But despite the grimy chai, the ambiance of the shop gives me the impression that we may have ordered incorrectly, and we'd be willing (albeit reluctant) to try Prodigy again.",2,8/26/2018,0,0,0,40.7302096,-74.0032381
Prodigy Coffee,4,"Prodigy Coffee NY Manhattan West Village 1:30pm Thursday 6th August 2015 Five Stars  It's a pretty quiet shop with four different people having setup shop here: laptops, plugins, bags, four cups of coffee.

What caught my eye was their signature drink ""Frost Bite"" which their cold brew poured over Shaved Ice $6. I am not sure why someone would pay an extra $2 for shaved ice other than for its novelty but hey why not.

The foam was creamy, the coffee superb. The barista was friendly enough, and service was quick.

It was a strange find since it was inside the lobby of an office building, but I spotted the sign directing people on 5th avenue to caffeine and I was in need of a jolt.  They were, I think, tidying up to prep for closing...not that it was approaching that time...but because of that, when one of the baristas went to make our lattes, the other instructed him to make the lattes one after the other instead of ""dirtying"" the other espresso machine that had obviously been cleaned for the last time. It was awkward because we just stood around waiting for him to make them 1 by 1. I guess it could be worse. Then, one barista was looking to throw out their huge garbage bags from the day, so she instructed us to move our bag off the coffee bar that lifts so that they can leave, and we had to awkwardly squish to the front of the coffee bar so she, and 2 huge garbage bags (gross) could push past us and get out of the shop.

PROOF Coffee Roasters,4,"Yeah, so Dough Donuts, Australian-style flat whites served by an actual Australian dude, ridiculously awesome staff, and a sharp, peppery tasting espresso all make this spot a stone cold 5 star coffee shop.  What boggles my mind is that people actually work in the office building that this coffee shop is hidden inside and that they can just wander downstairs and drink this stuff any time they like.  As for finding the spot just go into 420 5th Ave. Don't make the mistake (like I did) of even attempting to look for it on the street or side street or whatever, just walk into the 420 5th ave office building and you will find it in the lobby off to the side.  Today I got glazed and passionfruit cocoa nib dough donuts (which were both awesome) and a quad. The espresso here is strong and it is of a much darker roast than you might find at a Stumptown or Blue Bottle. In this way the espresso itself may have a more wide appeal because it inches more toward the tannic Starbucks style. However, make no mistake, the stuff pulled here is of an extremely high quality.  This place is hands down one of the best spots for coffee in the area, for something at all comparable you have to go 20 blocks uptown and 2 avenues over to Little Collins (which is wayyyyyy more crowded because no one knows about Hole in the Wall). Also, Dough donuts.  So yeah, a pretty sweet place. I am sure someday someone will come along and try to drag this place down from 5 stars but in my heart Hole in the Wall will always be perfect.",2,4/8/2016,1,0,1,40.7508316,-73.98337555

Red Fleece Caf̩,4.5,"I walked past the sign for Red Fleece Cafe (in the basement of Flatiron's Brooks Brothers) almost everyday on my way to work last summer and always wanted to go in but just never did. I did today and it was a disappointment!  First off: service was good. Friendly and patient as I was indecisive over what to order.  Aesthetic: honestly loved the interior design of Red Fleece. Very rustic lodge-y. There's a few big comfy sofas, lots of outlets and tables, lots of books...I could see myself camping out there for the day.  Drink: I tried the horchata cold brew and I enjoyed it for the first five minutes and then all of a sudden couldn't drink another sip. $5.50 ($6ish with tip). I just didn't like the mix of cinnamon with vanilla flavoring and coffee. It was also very small :(  My friend enjoyed his drink and I'm pretty sure I just didn't order the right drink. I wish I'd been able to sample it first!  Overall: I'd still be back just for the free WiFi, interior design, and rustic warm vibe.

Red Fleece Caf̩,4.5,"Hallelujah, there's a place serving Stumptown near my office, and it's only a block away!  This little cafe is tucked away in the basement of Brooks Brothers. I'd normally never step inside the store, but the need for caffeine has changed that. The atmosphere was very cozy. It's a relatively new spot, and whenever I go there are barely any people, so I get to order right away. That's a rare find for any coffee shop on a weekday morning.  They serve a variety of hot and iced drinks, namely coffee and teas. I got a soy latte and it was excellent. The menu didn't list iced lattes, so I was worried they wouldn't be able to fulfill my summertime needs (planning ahead never hurts). Luckily, it's an option. The downside is... it cost me $7 for a medium soy iced latte. I think it's $1 for a milk substitution and $1 to make it iced, which is kind of ludicrous. I'll just stick with their regular soy lattes from now on. They also have Balthazar pastries on display. The sticky buns, scones and monkey bread looked mighty good.  Also, the coffee cups have an ""in style"" design! The promo images were decorated in houndstooth, but when I went it was plaid. Either way, you get a little fashion statement on your cup, which is a cute little touch tying it in with the store.",2,3/17/2017,1,0,0,40.7391446,-73.9900695

They have free WiFi as well so it made it a nice place to study. Their plants add a lot of life to the shop. Several people came in not for the coffee but to purchase some flowers and plants.

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"Overall bad experience. Went in one morning for a coffee and it took two bored baristas a whole five minutes to get me a simple coffee which was overpriced, I mean it was le Colombe coffee, it shouldn't be over $3 for a small.  The barista (who was quite rude, not smart as I was the only customer) filled my cup a little over 2/3 even after I said ""no room for milk"" and she nodded, clearly hearing me.  The concept is an ok idea, but it's too bright inside and not a typical warm, inviting cafe. It feels more like a convenience store with the bright lights and smell - not of coffee or food, but of musty plants. Also, the seating was strange, an ill conceived plan that is again, not inviting at all. I only went in because I liked the idea of flowers and coffee and wanted to support a new business, but nothing about the place made me want to return. I'm sure it will survive, however, people like paying too much for middling food and bad service.",2,12/13/2017,2,0,1,40.70544486,-73.99429321

I ordered the matcha latte and looked at the very few, sad looking pastries in the case but decided against one. Maybe it's just the timing but there were only one muffin, two pastries and one oat bar available and none of them looked appetizing.  My matcha was sub-par. Upon first sip I couldn't place it, but as I kept drinking, I realized it was almost half water when I ordered mine with oat milk (up charge - which I'm fine with paying if I get the oat milk... not water).

Wifi works great and it can get a bit loud depending on who is sitting in the cafe that day since the cafe is so small after all. Unfortunately, there are no bathrooms, which means stay as long as you can hold your pee!

Saltwater Coffee,5,"While it's upsetting that we live in an East Village where a good local coffee shop is a novelty, Saltwater Coffee gives one hope like a flower sprouting up between cracks in the sidewalk.  They offer super high-quality beans and friendly but not chatty baristas who speedily knock out everything from basic drips to matcha lattes.  If you need, there are Balthazar baked goods too.  And refreshingly, that's it.  The most wonderful thing about Saltwater Coffee may be what it isn't.  There are no frills, no groups of moms with strollers, or tables claimed by territorial freelancers.  It's not trying to be anything beyond a solid little neighborhood coffee shop.  The shop itself is small but bright with a light Danish design touch and an Australian influence.  For East Villagers with discerning taste, it has quickly become the go-to.  If there's a down note, it's the menu pricing, which may be the only thing Saltwater doesn't nail. Currently, nearly all menu items leave customers with totals of a few cents over the dollar--and no one likes getting .95, .89 or even .60 cents in change. It's a close call whether this pricing scheme is more annoying for customers who get a fistful of coins or the poor baristas who have to count it all out a hundred times each morning.  It's hard to imagine that store runners won't soon round down prices to make everyone's life easier, but until they do, just pay with plastic.  On the whole, though, Saltwater is an excellent neighborhood addition to the top of the East Village.

Taylor St Baristas,4,"All I have to say is - $5 for a blueberry muffin? Are you kidding me? Price wasn't listed and I admit it was my mistake for not asking first (I paid with the app so didn't see the total) but it was smaller than the size of my fist and I didn't think it would be so out of the realm of the other baked goods' prices. When I went back in and asked how much it had cost, the answer I received was: ""We bake them in-house."" That's perfectly reasonable -- it really is -- but at that price, you'd think it'd be a large enough muffin, and one of the best ones in town. In fact, the flavor was mediocre, and it was soggy in the middle. I'd asked for it to be heated up, but figured it would just be popped in the toaster or whatever. So I'm not sure how the sogginess occurred, but anyway.  Pic attached with a bottle of nail polish for scale. Size aside, it was a pretty average muffin. This was not worth it at all.

Taylor St Baristas,4,"I honestly wish i could give this place a higher review, the place was chic with great interior designs, had lots of space, and an overall modern vibe. The food was not amazing and slightly overpriced, but hey, it's NYC so i'll accept it.  The reason for the two stars is for the lack of communication we received from our server regarding ""changes in the avocado market"".  Yeah, are you just as confused as I was?  I ordered avocado toast with salmon and an egg from this place, and the price listed on BOTH the cafe's blackboard and the menu was $15.50 (or something close to that number, I don't quite remember the exacts); the toast was pricey enough as it was, but when I received the check, the toast was somehow $3 more than the listed price. When I approached our waitress regarding the price of my toast, she nonchalantly told me that because there had been a ""change in the avocado market"", and overall the price of avocados have gone up, so they're charging customers more.  ......excuse me? if you're going to charge your customers more on something, shouldn't it be appropriate to at least inform them before they place their orders?  I was not hesitant on showing my dismay, and as a result, our waitress reluctantly took off the additional $3 on our check.

My friend said that she always does work there because there is a plethora of outlets and it has a really nice vibe. Although we didn't get food, the people around me ordered delicious-looking food. This place is highly instagram worthy and is a great place to study.  After I got back to my office, I realized that I left my scarf at the cafe.

I called the number on the Yelp page and I'm 99% sure I ended up leaving a voicemail on someone's personal cell phone. I sent them a message over Yelp, emailed them, and tweeted them. Luckily, after a few tweets back and forth, they told me that they had my scarf and that it was stored away. I realize how lucky I am and am so thankful for Taylor St Baristas' friendly service.

Taylor St Baristas,4,"I moved to NYC in January not knowing much about coffee. However, since moving here I have learned a little (still have a long way to go) and can now decipher between a good cup of coffee and a bad one at the very least.  Taylor St Baristas is among my favorite coffee shops. Both of my jobs are in Midtown and this place is snug between them, which makes my life, a heck of a lot better. My friend and I did tai chi one morning before work in Bryant Park and set off to Taylor St since we had about 40 minutes to spare before we both needed to be at work.  As soon as we walked in, we were greeted like friends. The barista (wish I caught her name, shes originally from south Africa if employers are reading;) ) was super friendly and helpful as we asked questions about what their cafe is known for. Immediately gave us the history and culture behind the cafe, and explained to us about their popular flat white. She also explained to two different types. The classic (which is what I got) which gave it a smooth, chocolate taste, and the other one (my friend got) which had a more fruitful flavor. We also ordered a slice of banana bread to split. The barista also suggested that she put butter on it and warm it up for us (score!).  We went upstairs to sit, and when our items were ready the server brought them to us, Everything from the decorations, to the coffee, to the bread was amazing. It was one of the best flat whites I have ever had, and I can't wait to go back to try the more fruity one just to try!  Also, their royalty program is great.

While it is neatly organized and aestethicgally pleasing, I just can't help but shake the feeling I was being indoctrinated and absorbing Falun Dafa via osmosis...anyways, THAT is my own personal view...but if you love Falun Dafa, I'm sure you would find it very calming.

Tianti Books,4,"So unbelievably overrated; I honestly can't believe this has a 4.5 stars on yelp. First off, it's seriously problematic that this Asian cafe is run by entirely white people. Not a bad concept space wise but it was ridiculous to see a white man giving a meditation lesson based off Asian meditation techniques surrounded by books in Asian languages.  My friend ordered a $9 tea -- completely outrageous (I think it was a rose tea?) I didn't even know you could charge that much for a cup of tea. It was pretty good but nothing special. I ordered an earl Grey latte, which tasted extremely watered down and couldn't even be called a latte (it was basically tea with milk and sweetener). Also not worth the price (around $5).  The heat was also off THE DAY AFTER A HUGE SNOWSTORM. They were relying on these tiny intermittent space heaters that really didn't do much. My friend went to order another hot drink, and the guy at the counter finally got the hint and offered to turn on the heat.  That being said, it's generally pretty empty and a great place to work since it's quiet and spacious.

This just tasted like milk with no matcha, no tea flavor, and barely any honeydew flavor, and the boba had a bad texture.  I see that most of the good reviews are for other items on their menu.

But here's why it's getting the 2 stars:  I bought the Aussie Waffles to go (Waffles with Bacon and Eggs) and it wasn't great:  1. The waffles was super bland.  2. The syrup it came with wasn't as thick as any other syrup. In fact it was a bit watery.  3. Some of the waffle/breakfast places usually gives you butter with waffles along with the syrup. This doesn't come with butter at all. I don't know if they forgot to add the butter or they just don't add it at all.  4. The bacon was a bit too salty.  5. The eggs wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best.  6. The sad part about this is that all of this was $11 something. There's other places (even at lower income neighborhoods) that have better tasting waffles, bacon and eggs for half the price. I feel that this was overpriced.  Nice staff and atmosphere.

We ordered the chocolate waffles, the Aussie waffles, and the cocoa waffle with mashed avocado.  All waffles were soft and chewy and cold - major disappointment.  Aunt Jemima waffles heated in my toaster oven come out crispy and soft on the inside, much better than what we got here.  On top of that, no butter was offered for the aussie and the chocolate waffles.  Also, when I asked for syrup, they pointed me to the two bottles next to the napkin station - one was for honey and the other one for a very liquidy syrup, which I believe might have been for the coffee.    Decor is cute, but seating is lacking.  Tables were taken by guests who were lingering over their cup of coffee.  There is limited counter seating along the window and one wall.

If you have ever struggled to find just one wooden chair at Starbucks, then you will appreciate how nice the ambiance is here.  2Beans makes their specialty drinks too sweet for my taste - I ordered the Autumn in NY cappuccino but will choose something more basic next time. My drink was also really small (more of a tea cup rather than a standard coffee cup size).

About Coffee,4.5,"Hate to give this cozy, unassuming coffee shop a mediocre review- but folks should know that this isn't the place to visit for pastries/food. While the coffee is decent and the service is good, the pastries are some of the most disappointing I've experienced. The chocolate croissant, for example, had zero fluffiness- tasted like a bland, day old stale croissant even though it was only 8:30AM. The same was true for their ham and cheese croissant. This was especially disappointing because both looked so good and were semi-egregiously priced between $3.50 and $4.50.  That said, the coffee is decent and this is a more low-key cafe alternative to Dominique Ansel around the corner.",3,12/12/2017,0,0,0,40.72452277,-74.00391966

Ironically, I craved a chai latte (even though it was nearly 80 degrees outside in October, go figure) so that's what I ordered. Sadly it just didn't hit the bar for chai lattes; felt like too much hot water and not enough chai, if you know what I mean.  Anyway, my drink was meh but the space is cute and I got some work done.

Bean & Bean,4,"This is a nice interior coffee shop! I felt the customer service was a 3 because the server seemed really hasty to take order and not really communicate with the customer.

There is some space/seating to do work and meet with friend. My matcha hot latte was 5.40$ ish and that's pretty $$ but it did give me a lot of energy. It is near battery park and Nyack college so convenient. The mood is definitely rustic and it's above UPS store so it's easy to miss it! Their ice chai tea is great but also 4.90$ for such a small cup. #NYC haha I would come back for their pastries, and to work there.",3,10/4/2017,1,0,0,40.70730642,-74.01220905
Bean & Bean,4,We stopped here for breakfast on a Saturday . It's a cold stainless steel place. I suppose very urban and I guess based upon its location is good for those who work nearby.

For a coffee shop that boasts about its organic nature and all that fanciness, I honestly did notice anything more robust or different about their coffee. Interior-wise, the industrial-like interior felt quite cold and uninviting. But on the plus side, I stayed for around 3 hours just to do some work and wasn't kicked out or anything.

On the plus side there coffee is organic. I feel there prices are cheap which is great!!! When you drink as much coffee as I do and being able to paying under $4 for a large ice coffee makes me a very happy camper.

I do, however, stop in from time to time for a cup of coffee and a muffin on the way to work.  The coffee is excellent - been enjoying their Tanzanian Peaberry pour over lately.  Staff is chill, good music, not too busy, definitely not overcrowded, and they keep it moving.  The muffins are so good I now have muffin handles, which is not a good thing.  Drat!  No more muffins for a while.  Nice place to stop for well selected, well prepared coffee, caring staff, and a place to sit if you are so inclined.  Pour over and muffin comes to $8, which is a reflection of drinking a single origin coffee prepared lovingly with patience.

Just finished it and I'm left wishing I ordered a larger size :) This is kind of of coffee that would go well with dark chocolate.

I got a large tea for $2.35. I kind of wish they had had more decaffeinated choices.  I read here for an hour. The music here was all over the place: r&b, pop, folky...

Birch Coffee,4,"I came here when I had to kill about an hour in the area. The sign outside said they had cold coffee drinks and it was cold inside, so I said why not?  I ordered the cold brew -- don't judge me! It tasted pretty great even black, which always says good things about the coffee.  The shop was pretty tiny with one communal table and a few seats by the window, so there isn't much room. The staff was pleasant enough: not overly friendly but decent.  My biggest complaint is the lack of Wifi. I was pretty sure that's a staple at coffee shops!",3,10/14/2018,0,0,0,40.7433787,-73.9800679

Birch Coffee,4,"Mmmmm... coffee.  I love good coffee. Sadly my cold brew tasted very bland/watered down, or something just didn't taste right :( However my friends said their cappuccino and macchiato were pretty good. The staff were quick and efficient but not the friendliest. They gave me this look when I asked for milk to put in my cold brew.  I did like the interior/ambience of the cafe. It's a bit small so it's a nice spot to stop by for a quick coffee, but probs not the ideal place to sit down and get some work done.  I'd def be down to try their hot drinks next time when I'm in the area!",3,1/1/2019,0,1,0,40.7433787,-73.9800679

Birch Coffee,4,"I stopped into Birch for the first time on a sweltering summer day to finish up some readings for a class. The interior is tiny, with enough seating for perhaps 10, which turned out to be more than enough spots for all the patrons sipping in. It  at first seemed quite warm inside, but I got used to the temperature pretty quickly and gene really thought the room felt pleasant.  I ordered a large cold brew with a splash of milk and settled in on a stool facing the street. The cold brew was exactly as it should be: bold and aromatic. The cold brew that I've sampled tends to taste pretty similar most places, but that's fine because it's usually good.  One minor complaint is that the establishment has no public bathroom. I was directed to the library down the street, which wasn't a problem, but the bathroom there was a little gross.",3,6/18/2016,2,1,2,40.7433787,-73.9800679

Birch Coffee,4,"I had the chance to visit this Birch Coffee location while catching up with friend who was visiting the city. I've been to several Birch locations but this was my first time at their spot on west 14th street.  Walking in I instantly noticed that it's smaller than their other locations around the city. It has about four high top tables and a small counter top where you're able to enjoy your beverage. Honestly though I'd say this spot is best to grab and go with your coffee since the seats fill up pretty fast.  I ended up ordering a small 12 oz. coffee that came out to be $2.75. Compared to other options in the area I'd say this was a little steep as well, especially given the fact they only had one brew.  Overall an ok spot to grab a quick coffee and head out. There are a few other options in the area with larger seating spaces I'd check out first though if that's something you're looking for.",3,3/24/2019,3,1,2,40.7384331,-74.0002196
Birch Coffee,4,"I had a good experience here. The space is very small - smaller then most other coffee shops. There's no space for lingering...you come in, get your order and have to move on your way.  The cold brew was decent. I was in and out quickly during rush hour. There were a good amount of employees on, so everything moved fluidly. Got caught snapping a photo of the menu for my Yelp check-in. Always feel a bit strange trying to snap those.  I will likely return to try something else on the menu. Sounds like some of the other menu items may be worth another try.",3,5/10/2018,0,0,0,40.7384331,-74.0002196
Birch Coffee,4,"Birch a solid little coffee shop on the edge of the West Village.  It is less of a coffee shop in the classic sense, where you pull up a table and do work or snuggle up in an easy chair and read a book over your chai latte.  It is more of a coffee kiosk.  It is a very small shop, with only a few stools.  Also, the menu of pastries, etc. is limited as well.  However, if you are looking for good coffee to get in get out and go on your way, this is a good place for you.    Personally, I am not a huge fan of their coffee, but it is pretty good.  I think the taste part of coffee all comes down to personal preference.  Regarding the get in/out/go part, they are located about 50 feet from the 1/2/3 14th Street stop.",3,12/19/2016,2,0,1,40.7384331,-74.0002196

Walked in at 7:49, they close at 8, and the employees told me they couldn't serve me anything but iced coffee or tea because the machine ""shuts itself down"" and was already turned off. I used to be a barista so I'm pretty sure that was a lie. Even if it was hypothetically true, the machine should shut down at 8 when the store closes.

Birch Coffee,4,"Great coffee, though it took forever (they're on par with Blue Bottle waiting times here). I get it, though - it takes time for the good stuff. Anyway, I had a great skim latte and my friend liked her cortado.  Edit 7/2018: iced coffee is excellent and they serve Underwest Doughnuts now. Can't go wrong with the Car Wash!!

Birch Coffee,4,"Birch risks feeling pretentious with a tiny area and fairly high prices, but the friendly staff makes it feel more human. There are only three small tables inside and some room at the bar, but not restroom. The coffee is solid, about what you'd get at Stumptown, not as good as Blue Bottle.

I've been here twice and twice I've been disappointed with my latte.   Not only is the cup tiny, the latte itself is extremely acidic. I don't know if it's the beans they use or it's just not prepared well, but the coffee tastes acrid.   The place itself is very small and can feel cramped. There's also no wifi and no bathroom.

Aside from that, I always love Birch for its high quality beverages and top notch staff, I'm not an expert on coffee but I've only gotten great cups here. This is a terrific stop off for anyone in need of some Joe while crossing thru the neighborhood or getting some errands done- they also have a nice atmosphere (even better whenever that door gets some grease) and a casual coffee meet, or a place to get some typing done, great place. They only have a few seats so only a few folks at a time can hang, but it's a cozy and nice place when you get a table.",3,12/19/2017,1,0,0,40.7384331,-74.0002196

These people really know coffee and aim to deliver the highest quality experience and coffee to their customers!  I was able to try a variety of their desserts and I was blown away! My favorites were probably the matcha and sesame cakes. They were both so moist and flavorful...I'm not usually a huge fan of dessert, but these two items surprised me! Absolutely delicious.

Blue Stripes Cacao Shop,4.5,We had a white chocolate chai latte and a lava cake with toppings. We LOVED the drink but the cake was meh. Lava cake should have warm gooey chocolate flowing like LAVA when cut in the middle but it had jelly like filling inside. We asked but they said this is how they meant it to be.... (?) So my recommendation is not to expect lava when you order lava cake here.,3,4/17/2019,1,1,0,40.7346342,-73.992897
Blue Stripes Cacao Shop,4.5,"Blue stripes cacao shop is a restaurant opened by the brother of the nearby Max Brenner. This is a much smaller (and much less crowded) version with lots of chocolate. The vibe is very homey - filled with plants and light and a little library in the back where you can pick up a book to read. They have a separate communal table where you can use your laptop, and then another set of tables along the wall for people looking to enjoy their food.  We got the nutella hot cocoa and the lemon donut fondue. I thought the hot chocolate was amazing - it wasn't too sweet or heavy, but was really rich. I was less impressed by the lemon donut fondue - the lemon in the mini donuts was overpowering and they only gave a really small thing of chocolate. For $11 I thought it wasn't worth it.  Overall, would come here again for another hot cocoa and perhaps a pastry. I like it much better than Max Brenner. Would recommend for a casual date or meeting up with a friend (who really loves chocolate).",3,7/18/2018,0,0,0,40.7346342,-73.992897
Blue Stripes Cacao Shop,4.5,"We had a great second experience at Blue Stripes. Tried four unique and delicious chocolatey treats.  First was the chocolate cloud. The cloud dispenser has been updated since our first visit a few weeks ago. The drink truly tasted like chocolate mousse in drinkable form. The chocolate flavor was richer than the Nutella I previously tried - I would recommend it for a dark chocolate lover. It is best to drink it fast as it gets a little less fluffy the longer it sits.  We also tried the Nutella roll. This was my favorite. The bun is soft and moist, coated in layers of Nutella. So delicious.  Next was the lemon poppyseed donuts with milk chocolate fondue. I've never mixed lemon and chocolate flavors before and I thought it worked very well.  Finally, we tried a chocolate smoothie with fruit and pistachios. They are apparently the only place that they know of to serve drinks made of this particular part of the chocolate plant, which is a known superfood. It was delicious and not overly sweet, in fact quite refreshing.  As a chocolate lover, I appreciate the creativity that the shop is going for.

Luckily, while searching Yelp, Blue Stripes Cacao Shop showed up and was in walking distance. I decided to give it a try and ordered a mocha. Service was friendly and my drink was served up quickly. There is a lot of seating however it was pretty packed on an early Friday afternoon. If you wait around you can definitely score a seat though, as there is a lot of turnover. There is also a clean bathroom which is nice and they have a self-serve water station. Since this is a cacao shop the mocha was extra thiccc and chocolatey.

Bluestone Lane Collective Cafe,4,"I would give this place 3.5 stars.  I really only come here if I'm in the area and don't feel like walking to go to a better brunch place.  I usually order the green baked eggs (spinach, eggs, feta cheese, tomatoes, mushrooms. chimichurri, Balthazar toast) on the brunch menu.  I really only order it because it has the most vegetables.  It's fresh, delicious, and not too heavy.  It's a bit watery (due to the spinach and the tomatoes) but if you add chili oil, it tastes really good.  As of late, it's getting harder and harder to get a table for brunch.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table at 11:30 AM which usually is not a busy time.  Also, their service has gotten super slow.  I have to wait a long time to get anything: water, check, etc.  I will have to have to come here earlier to get a table, at least they do open at 8:00 AM.",3,12/17/2018,0,1,1,40.7358109,-74.0009087

I like that they have the brekki board that has half of Collective granola and half of Avocado smash. The granola is ok. Personally I think the yogurt is too thick with no flavor. The citrus curd gives the sweet flavor but they don't put enough. I like the avocado smash. It has thick layer of avocado and a bit of salad on top and you get to choose the topping: egg, salmon, bacon, etc. This place is small but they have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.

Bluestone Lane Collective Cafe,4,"Typical hipster place so I get it and I get the hype. However, management is poor and service is all over the place. There is no system whatsoever and our food (which should've taken 20 minutes MAX to make and serve) took over 45 minutes to come out. This was even after asking FOUR times to just bring it out as it was ready. But the waitresses/ waiters were just running around manning random tables and doing random things. We had like 3 people helping us to had to repeat the same thing to three different people.  However, I will give them 2 stars as the food was good. I got the brekkie board which is half avocado toast and half the yogurt with granola. Avocado toast is avocado toast. The yogurt and granola however was very delicious. My bf got the green baked eggs which he said was good but the portion was too small. We also shared the banana bread which was good but for 13$ I expect more than 2 small slices of bread.

The only thing that I forgot to tell them was not to add the ricotta because I wouldn't like the taste of it. The avocado smash was on balthazar toast.

Bluestone Lane Collective Cafe,4,"Australian brekkies are starting to become more prevalent and that's not a bad thing. Like most popular brunch spots, fills up fast, but was able to get a table of four with only a small wait.  Lots of options including old standbys like avocado smash. Wanted to try the Bacon Melt, but they were sold out (as well as all ice creams). Settled on the Balthazar toast with avocado and Vegemite ($8). Always wanted to try Vegemite - a thick paste with an intense tart-like flavor. Wasn't really my thing, so stuck mostly with the avocado on the thick toast. Also got to try the Pumpkin pancakes - served with a delicious maple syrup and topped with pecans/pumpkin seeds. The pancakes themselves were a little on the tough side, yet I really liked the syrup.  Service here is friendly despite being busy. I also liked the Australian beer offerings.

Bluestone Lane Collective Cafe,4,"The Quick: Delicious coffee, flavorful different brunch options, and friendly staff. Great place to bring a book and spend a few hours, just note the food is pricey.  The Details: You walk in to this cozy little coffee spot which seems to be crowded at all times of the day. Many of the staff members have an Australian accent (which I love!)  and everyone is very attractive. If possible, try to get a seat in the front which is perfect for people watching. The back room is cozy as well but has less lighting and less seats available by a window.  The coffee was fantastic and extremely reasonably priced ($1.50). Per staff recommendation, I got the flat white which is similar to a cappuccino but stronger.    Best Dish: Now the food is where it gets interesting. I ordered the pumpkin and feta fritter which was extremely different, flavorful, and mouthwatering. It's basically pumpkin and feta baked together until crispy, than covered in avocado/ guacamole goodness. From here, they top it with greens, pickled beets, and a side of smoked salmon.  If you logically think about all of these flavor combinations, it's mind-boggling. It was honestly one of the most delicious and exotic brunch dish I've ever eaten. I added a poached egg which was overcooked so it didn't add much flavor, however it did help fill me up.  This dish was outstanding and I'd recommend it to anyone, however it isn't heavy and could leave you a bit hungry. If your looking for a light and healthy brunch/breakfast this is perfect. If you're starved, I wouldn't recommend.  The Damage: My delicious entree + coffee came to $23 + tip. I felt it was pricey as I am still hungry, but with quality ingredients I think it's worth the splurge.  Cannot wait to return!",3,3/31/2015,4,1,3,40.7358109,-74.0009087
Bluestone Lane Collective Cafe,4,"Let me start with the positive: the restaurant is really quaint with lots of light in a charming area of the west village. Very cute interior.  Ok, now the Cons:  The food is expensive but not very good. I got the brekkie board and my friend got the avocado smash. In both dishes the bread was so tough we could barely bite into it. I cut the roof of my mouth. I asked for a steak knife. The avocado was off, and no amount of spices added could fool you into thinking it wasn't. The yogurt was tasty but with only one sad little hazelnut sitting on the granola. Stingy for how much it cost ($16).  They tried to fit too many tables into this space. It's not ""cosy"" but cramped and uncomfortable. Our table was uneven. I held it straight with my knee the whole meal.  The server came over a total of once and rushed us through the order. I tipped high but wondered why. If the food was relatively cheap I'd be less critical, but it really wasn't. It's frustrating when you spend a NYC brunch budget on a very underwhelming (with rotten produce) meal and tip a server that you can't spot in a tiny space.  The coffee wasn't bad but we didn't get it for 15 minutes.  Worst part? My friend is from Australia and is incredibly homesick so I took her here to experience a taste of home. She left without saying much. She is very polite.",3,7/16/2016,0,0,0,40.7358109,-74.0009087

I got the avocado smash toast (I swear there's a whole avocado on this, I love it). There was feta cheese, and halved cherry tomatoes. I suggest adding on a poached egg (+ $3) so worth it. Along with it, I got the magic. I had asked my server what it was, with a name like magic you just have to ask. I thought it was spiked or something. She actually didn't know and had to ask someone inside.. :/ But maybe she was new, who knows? So what it turns out to be is that it's similar to a latte, but smaller. And more espresso, less milk.  Service is quick and friendly. Kinda reminds me of the cute trendy cafes in Amsterdam. Would come again, I hear the breakfast foods are great. Brunch is served till 4!

They always seems to come up with new and innovative ways to disappoint. I went for breakfast with my wife and we had 30min to have breakfast, surely enough time. Of course not at Bluestone, even though the place was near empty. After we order our drinks and they arrive the waitress tells me that they have no food yet because their kitchen is late in opening. This happened at 8:15am. They open at 8am. No offer to comp the teas we had to just leave them simmering on the table because we had to go eat something something somewhere with actual food before we had to go to work. They could have told us this when we arrived and we would have had time to go somewhere else, but they just don't care here I suppose.  This place always has this weird vibe. Not great. Also, food is way too expensive for what it is. A piece of dry bread with some fruits in it was my order the previous time. That was $11 with tax and tip...

Waitress and barista seemed to have a snigger as if I didn't know how to drink/appreciate my coffee and it was meant to be that way. - when I asked for a lid for my takeaway coffee, the barista gave me a filthy look and told me they were ""over there on your way out"" - the check came back and when I asked for the second coffee to be taken off my check (which I hadn't had more of a sip of, again this was a big deal and made me feel like I was trying to scam a free coffee)!  Sorry guys, this kind of sloppiness and attitude might be acceptable in Australia where your hourly rate is paid no matter what, but in NY you won't survive another six months like this.

And I was still only charged for one so that was cool, I don't know if they changed their portion size but that was a nice surprise -Atmosphere- I headed to the back to check it out and almost started crying, it really felt so much like I could grab that chai latte and walk down to the beach, I think I need to book a plane ticket  The Ehhhhh (I don't want to say bad, nothing was truly awful) -Our Table- They were busy, it was raining so they couldn't use the outside, and their place is small, none of which of course, is their fault at all. The issue became when we were kind of forced into taking a seat at the window bar and be served there. The (i'm guessing) manager pointed to the seats and was like ""That's all I have, sorry we're busy this morning"" which normally we would've been okay with but I currently have a broken ankle and I couldn't freaking fit my foot between the chair and the wall and spent the entire meal in crazy amounts of pain. We weren't really in a hurry to sit, if he had asked us we would've told him that we would wait for a better table for me. But we felt rushed into taking it and I guess hoped against hope that he would take my obviously broken ankle into account before we were sat. It just would've been nice if I hadn't been sat at such an obviously non handicapped friendly seat (I realize this is NYC and that doesn't happen, it just would've been nice) -Service- Waited quite a bit for menus, waited quite a bit for water. They were busy, I get it. The barista was really combative towards my guy friends for some reason  Bottom Line: I don't know, it was truly a strange experience.",3,11/5/2014,3,0,0,40.7358109,-74.0009087
Bluestone Lane Collective Cafe,4,"This cozy Aussie caf̩ is smaller than I expected, but at 11 AM on a weekday I was easily able to get a table right away. Service is a bit slow, and not particularly friendly, but it was more impersonal than unpleasant. Unfortunately, they were out of mushrooms, so I couldn't get the portobello mushroom toast I was hoping for. I ordered the coconut quinoa porridge instead, which was tasty, but I was surprised to find that it was served cold. It had lots of fresh berries in it, which made it naturally sweet. I also asked for a side order of buttered toast (off-menu), and was shocked that it cost $6, but at least it was two thick slices of their prized whole grain bread. The iced latte was good, but they didn't make simple syrup available as they do at their Bryant Park location, so I couldn't sweeten it. I was able to charge my phone while sitting at the bar area, with a great view out the floor-to-ceiling windows, which was very handy. I definitely intend to go back again, to try the portobello mushroom toast.",3,8/4/2015,0,0,0,40.7358109,-74.0009087

I bought a loaf of bread but they couldn't slice  it because they had already cleaned the machine. (Yet they had a ton of bread left) The girl who was the manager really wanted everyone out of the shop because she wanted to close 20 minutes early. I wish they could put a sign on their door that they were closing early instead of being rude and unhelpful. They were open but I felt very unwelcome.  I wanted to have a quick coffee and pastry but changed my mind and went to Starbucks instead. Usually everyone is so nice in here but after tonight I will not rush back. I go to this place a lot.

Two customers can fit in here at one time before a line forms outside the door. Be mindful of that if you're coming on a rainy or particularly frigid day.  2. Management,  if you are reading this, you absolutely must start sourcing your coffee cups and lids from another vendor. I've been here five times and each time the coffee drops from the lid while the lid is secured on the cup; it's annoying and it hurts.

I think I was expecting a more hefty, creamy cheese filling rather than the almost light snack that the PDQ turned out to be! At 11am the popular flavors were all sold out so come early if you want to try something unusual like fig !  The brigadeiro croissant was huge and MESSY! I took mine to the seaport to eat and was hands deep in chocolate icing with no napkins. It was a wonderful time but not my best show as a functional adult.

Cafe Patoro,4.5,"This is an adorable cafe. For the longest time, I was searching for a Brazilian cafe that offered the infamous pao de quiejo, my favorite cheesy bread. It's a small shop but with plenty of choices. The woman who assisted me was very friendly and helpful. The pao de queijos were popular because when I ordered, it was nearly gone (and there were a lot of flavor options!). For $6, you get 5 slightly bigger than average pao de quiejos and had to get a slice of brigadeiro cake for $6.25, which looked amazing.  There were a few tables available so we decided to sit down: three adults and one stroller. The woman graciously offered to heat up my pao de quiejos which I immediately nodded with force. Nothing like warmed up bread to make my afternoon snack even better.  Thoughts on the five pao de quiejos:  Original - you can't go wrong with the classic. Got two of these and glad I did since we all shared it. It's just unbelievably fantastic, brings back memories when I first had this deliciousness 10 years ago at a Brazilian restaurant and still taste as fantastic as ever.  Pesto - hint of pesto flavor without being overwhelming.  Pepperoni - i love pepperoni so thought this would be cool to try. Little bits of pepperoni are embedded in the pao de quiejo. Light aroma, good taste.  Roasted garlic - for those who love garlic, this would be a great treat. Very fragrant and a subtle smell yet strong taste when you bite into it.  All of the pao de queijos had great consistency and pulled apart nicely. Of course, as I received my items, a fresh batch of originals come out of the oven...melt*.  Brigadeiro - never had this cake but saw lots of reviews and photos on this and of course had to try! It looked like a piece of yummy chocolate cake. The description for it is a dark chocolate cake with Brazilian chocolate truffle filling. Fairly small sized slice of cake for $6.25. But the richness, consistency, texture, freshness and taste make up for it. Not sugarly or too sweet, right amount of dark chocolate without being bitter, perfect amount of filling and frosting/sprinkles. Good pick and so glad I tried it. It felt like a guiltless dessert.  My mom tried the coffee there and loved it. She went with the Colombian blend and it was so aromatic! No need for sugar...that's how delicious it was. Adorable spot. My husband wanted to try the cold brew but already had his max for the day. Would definitely come back to satisfy a weekend afternoon craving.",3,8/1/2017,1,1,2,40.7072721,-74.00231604
Cafe Patoro,4.5,"This cafe's high rating is well deserved. As a Brazilian American, I can say their p̣o de quiejos are legit and delicious. We had original PDQ's, roasted garlic, and maple bacon because we just had to try one of their adventurous flavors. Let's just say none of them disappointed. The espresso was also VERY good. My only regret is that I didn't get to try any of their brigadeiros (Brazilian chocolate truffles, basically).

Cafe Patoro,4.5,Tried all the pao de quejo's. The original one was the best by a landslide but it was the best of an incredibly poor to mediocre bunch. The ingredients didn't taste fresh or interesting and everything was overpriced. Very unimpressive and expensive bakery.,3,9/17/2017,2,3,0,40.7072721,-74.00231604
Cafe Patoro,4.5,"If you are unfamiliar with pao de queijo, I am urging you to head here and indulge in the cheesy goodness that is.  If you are familiar with pao de queijo, then I'm pretty sure you can agree that it is a delicacy, to say the least!  Cafe Patoro...as soon as you walk in you are greeted with smiles that are just as warm as pao de queijo. The aroma is a mix of sweet and savory as not only do they specialize in serving the cheesy Brazilian bread, they have a small collection of desserts, headlined by brigadeiros. Now...if that doesn't ring a bell either, I suggest you drop what you're doing and treat yourself! I promise you won't regret it!  Their pao de queijo is unique because it doesn't have the same texture as others I've had. It is a bit more crunchy on the outside and has a bit less cheese. I know what you're thinking...less cheese?! Who does that? But let me tell you that Cafe Patoro knows how to capture you because each piece is LOADED with flavor. Not only that, but they even have pao de queijo with toppings such as maple bacon. Now that's something I never thought I'd see. Unfortunately I don't eat pork so I can't review it, but the aroma will please your senses.  Their brigadeiros are very delicious as well. Not TOO sweet and just the right amount of everything. They have numerous flavors, but the regular chocolate truffle is enough to have you going loco!  I would put Cafe Patoro right up there with Pao De Queijo in Astoria. You will be happy with either, but if you ask me, why not go to both?!",3,5/27/2017,4,1,1,40.7072721,-74.00231604

It was unbelievably moist and I'm stilk craving it. I've also tasted all of their pao de queijo and mini sandwiches. I'm not Brazilian, but I'm pretty sure they're spot on and the breads are the perfect texture, nice and chewy! Oh and I'm addicted to the cornbread too ...",3,1/9/2019,0,0,0,40.7072721,-74.00231604

They have hot and cold coffee drinks, along with an array of sweet and savory treats. I ordered a cold latte mocha (which uses semi-sweet cocoa, so it doesn't taste too sugary!) and a corn empanada. My friends ordered mini quiches and really enjoyed them as well.  The staff is very friendly. It was admittedly slow service due to the fact that there was only 2 or 3 people working. Ambiance is cute and modern. There is a place for about 12 people to sit.  If you have time and are willing to spend a little more on specialty coffee and eats, this place is worth a shot.

Cafe Patoro,4.5,"This is my favorite bakery/cafe in Manhattan. Everything in here is made to perfection. From the food, drinks, atmosphere, employees and owners.  When you walk in you're greeted by warm staff, everything smells/tastes amazing and is affordable. Also their coffee comes from La Colombe which I am a huge fan of since it is so delicious. All the espressos come with double shots so they're nice and strong but not bitter at all. It's sooo delicious when I get iced latte with cream/milk and then put sugar in it. I always get the large size and they even have this amazing coffee card. Who doesn't love earning free drinks for delicious coffee?  Personally I have tried everything in here so far and my favorites are the iced lattes, corn bread (with coconut shavings and corn kernels), brigadero cake, brigadero truffles, spinach/heart of palm turnovers, mango juice, garlic pdq sandwiches, sohno de valso and bis candies. Literally the list could go on and on but if I could I would eat all of those every single day and not get tired of it.  The atmosphere is a nice place to sit down, listen to music, enjoy the food and wifi while exploring the Seaport area. If I could give this place more stars I would.

I had tried Cafe Patoro a couple years back when they had a stall in the outdoor market by Times Square and offered PDQ ""sandwiches.""

Caffe Marchio,4.5,"The Danny Meyer hype machine rolls on with his classic Italian complex of Marta, Vini e Fritti, and Caffe Marchio in the Redbury Hotel. I was going to the dentist in the area and decided to treat myself to pastries at the latter beforehand.  It was easy to spot, despite the construction. Inside wasn't as airy and bright as all of the press pictures suggest, probably because of the gloomy day and sunlight-blocking construction. It looks authentically European, and it was cute, but not that cute.  They have quite a few pastries on offer, and at reasonable prices ($1-4). I went with a hazelnut ball and a sour cherry pastry. My boyfriend had an egg sandwich.  His sandwich was pretty good. My cherry pastry didn't taste all that fresh (and we were there around 9 or so). The hazelnut one was slightly better, but still didn't blow my mind.  One annoyance is that we were standing around for a bit waiting for my pastries, even though there were 3 people working and no other customers. Eventually they noticed and then quickly bagged them up. Hospitality is otherwise good here.  Overall, this is not a bad choice if you find yourself in Murray Hill / Midtown East. Don't think it deserves a trip out of your way, nor all of the glowing press I've seen lavished on it.

They let me know how to set up the wifi and I had a beautiful writing moment before I had to head to work.

CHALAIT,4,"Teeny tiny matcha shop in Midtown, serving high quality Japanese tea, coffee, pastries, and a small selection of light fare. They refer to themselves as purveyors of fine matcha, with a mission to make the tea more palatable to the western world. Due to construction, there was no seating on the day I visited, but it looks like there is typically room for about 5 people. The concise menu includes hot and cold specialty matcha beverages, ranging from matcha hot chocolate to their matcha Americano.  I got an Iced Matcha Latte with oat milk, which was just okay. For $5.25, I was expecting the matcha flavor to be more intense, but it was barely distinguishable. While I enjoyed the subtle sweetness of the drink, it may as well have been a cup of iced hemp milk. When I asked if any of the baked goods were vegan, the barista rolled her eyes at me and pointed to a sliced Orange Poppyseed Loaf. The cake had a nice moist, delicate texture, but lacked flavor. I noticed a few vegan options on the food menu (PB&J Tartine, Matcha Smoothie Bowl), which are perhaps better.  $11 for an underwhelming latte and pastry felt overpriced, even in NYC.

While I understand it is nice to meet friendly people in New York, especially around midtown, waiting ten minutes in an almost empty cafe is crazy, and makes me think my personal time is not respected.

The place is small, VERY SMALL. It's mainly a to-go coffee shop rather than a dine in one. There are about 5 seats located in a hallway that leads to an elevator. I felt like I was awkwardly in people's way since several people kept passing by. The decor is very pretty and minimalistic. The food and drinks were expensive so we kept to ordering drinks only.  I ordered a hojicha hot chocolate. If you're not familiar, hojicha is toasted green tea. It has a unique flavor, very different from matcha. As much as I wanted to love my drink, I wasn't a big fan. I can taste the chocolate and hojicha but it was really drowned out by the milk. I do like that their hot chocolate is milk-based rather than water. I completely forgot what my boyfriend has ordered, but it was just alright. The service was quick and very friendly.  It's a good little spot if you're nearby and would like to grab a drink on the go. Overall, I wasn't really impressed with the drinks that we got.",3,3/22/2018,4,1,2,40.7462746,-73.9882491

CHALAIT,4,"Let me start by saying that the Smoked Salmon & Matcha Cream Cheese changed my entire perspective on smoked salmonWhatever they created here is so unique, and that cream cheese is difficult to describe but absolutely scrumdiddlyumptious. 10/10. The latte was amazing and I also had an orange juice which it was amazing. Unfortunately, I have to knock off a star because the dude serving me was so rude and nonchalant. I'm from California, and this is the new Toria's way of New York, but he was just so unenthusiastic that it was a daunting task to just ordera couple menu items. he made me feel like I was ruining his day (maybe I was?) Regardless, the food was amazing and I will definitely be back, but just prepared for that warm welcoming New York City service. Gang gang.",3,10/5/2018,0,0,0,40.7462746,-73.9882491
CHALAIT,4,"Yummy but expensive! Tried the iced matcha latte ($5.25), avocado toast ($10), and salmon sandwich ($11). The chimichurri sauce is really what makes the avocado toast, but that doesn't really justify the price for me. Matcha latte was also good. My sister tried the version with cashew almond milk which was so good but it was an extra DOLLAR. Yikes!  Plus there was about 4 seats in the entire cafe. We had to stand at the serving counter to eat, with barely enough room. Glad I checked this place out but would I come back? Likely not :/",3,6/4/2017,3,0,1,40.7462746,-73.9882491

CHALAIT,4,"Good matcha drinks and snacks. Not a great space.  The barista was super helpful and friendly. I enjoyed my matcha capp - the matcha taste was there, the milk was just lightly sweetened and well-foamed. However, definitely not a fan of the space. They just have about 4-5 barstools up against a bar table facing the wall...right in the middle of a hallway that leads from the door to an elevator that I guess leads to other office spaces/apartments? It was weird place to sit with so many people coming in and out, so I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a place to lounge for a bit/read/work. More of a grab-and-go.  Also, agree with the prices - a little overpriced for sure.",3,11/18/2017,3,0,0,40.7462746,-73.9882491
CHALAIT,4,"Don't kill me but I'm not a fan of matcha lattes. I'm not sure if the creaminess of milk syncs well with the bitterness of matcha and, despite ordering it every now and then in the hopes of finally falling in love with the taste, I have yet to really think of it as a first-choice drink. The matcha latte at Chalait may satisfy purists in that it hews more closely to matcha's original flavor but it's really quite bitter. Towards the middle, all I could taste was burnt tea. I much prefer Cha Cha Matcha's version.  The one thing I will say about Chalait is that its prices are emblematic of a bigger problem in NYC: extravagant prices for trendy, healthful, superfoods. On my first visit, I was desperate for a breakfast item and ended up lunging for one of the last tiny cups of bircher muesli. Which was $6. A box of regular old Swiss muesli and some almond milk is maybe $5 at my bodega. I really did like that muesli and it actually filled me up but it was definitely not worth $6.  Since then, I've also tried the super smoothie bowl and the butternut squash and cauliflower quinoa bowl. Just warning you that you may need a second meal after consuming both of these. The smoothie bowl, which sounded excellent on paper (so many ingredients AND PB), ended up being really watery. Unfortunately, without any particularly forceful ingredients (cacao nibs don't count) to really stand out, all I could taste was diluted banana. The butternut squash bowl was much better but with very few chunks of squash or cauliflower. If it weren't for the $12 price tag, I would want to get it again just for the Sriracha tahini dressing.  The times I swung by, I came well after the lunch rush; by then, most of the popular items had already sold out, including the matcha yogurt parfait.  My main complaint is with the space. Obviously a store must work with what it has architecturally speaking but this is definitely a grab and go joint. There are only about 4-5 stools, all pushed within inches apart, and you're facing a white wall. There's a giant GRIND sign pointing to the next floor, which I thought indicated a separate seating area, but thankfully the barista quickly informed me it was another office before I actually wandered up there. Next to the seating area is an elevator with more than a fair share of foot traffic. It must be nice for those employees to have a coffee place so close by but I gobbled down my muesli and dashed out of there. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this as a spot to work or read or while the afternoon away.",3,10/25/2017,3,2,1,40.7462746,-73.9882491
CHALAIT,4,"Probably my mistake but when I think of matcha latte, I think of something sweet. I should have asked the cashier if it was sweetened before I placed my order. MATCHA LATTE IS UNSWEETENED.  This small cafe has about 6 bar stools lined below a bar-type table attached to the wall, right next to the door. There's barely elbow room when all the seats are taken.  Latte art here is dependent on I guess the barista's mood. The customer before me received pretty latte art and well, I got an average looking heart. Pretty unimpressive.  The plain croissant was at least flaky and soft, clearly didn't taste stale.  Would not come back based on latte art and bitter matcha latte. I really hope in the future they create an option to have it sweetened.",3,1/20/2017,2,7,1,40.7462746,-73.9882491

From this location, there are about 7-9 stools. This place is instagram worthy. It may seem like there prices are pretty high, but their drinks are worth it. Came in on a Wednesday afternoon and the store was mostly packed. There was one stool that was available. The service was pretty attentive & they did greet me when I went in. They had a pretty wide amount of matcha drinks and that was perfect. I love matcha and I decided to get the Matcha Chocolate Latte and the Match granola yogurt. I didn't wait along time for my drink and it came out really pretty. Their latte art is on point!  Match Chocolate Latte: 5/5 stars. Matcha was throughly blended and there is a hint of chocolate in it. Not overly sweet and they do use whole milk. You may ask the barista to change the milk. Matcha granola yogurt: 4/5: Never tried Matcha granola yogurt and it was pretty good. The yogurt and granola was fresh and tasty.  I would come here again to try their other matcha drinks out!  They do sell other drinks in a mini refrigerator in the bottom of the cashier stand.  Wished they had WIFI in this cafe, that would've made it 5 stars.",3,10/7/2016,1,0,0,40.7462746,-73.9882491

CHALAIT,4,"I'm so glad Chalait has a location now in midtown! I like to swing by before work and grab a matcha latte; it's usually not too crowded when I get there (around 9 AM), but I'm not sure if it's because the location is still relatively new. It's also a bit more tucked away, so it can be easy to miss.  For drinks, I've only tried the matcha latte and the hojicha hot chocolate so I can only speak to those. Love the matcha latte and how strong the matcha flavor is; I really wish I liked the hojicha hot chocolate more, but I think the chocolate drowned out the hojicha flavor a bit. I hope they come out with a hojicha latte, though! (For those who have never had hojicha, it's a toasted green tea.)  There is also pretty much no seating here, so don't expect this to be a place to hang out with friends.

CHALAIT,4,"Officially open! The place is literally in an office building and only has seating for 4-5 people (next to the side entrance). They do offer breakfast-type food (think avocado toast and baked goods like croissant, muffins, & etc.).  Bought the Iced Matcha Latte with Almond Milk. Total came out to an estimate of $6 (almond milk was $.75 extra) [insert shock face for the price]. Don't get me wrong, I do love matcha, but it is expensive. Matcha powder usually costs around $10+ in a small can (30g), and if you're like me and too lazy to make matcha tea at home when you have the ingredients, you come to stores like these to have someone make the drinks for you.  Anyway, I do love Chalait for their minimalistic interior, and the products they offer.  The star knockoff was for the limited seating.",3,8/12/2016,2,1,0,40.7462746,-73.9882491

Chalait's coffee with their food definitely fuels my energy to boost the start of my day. The only thing I don't like about this location compared to their original location that got shut down is that there's so little seatings here. They have an extremely small bar counter against the wall with stool chairs that sits about 5 leaving a tight elbow to elbow space while the skinny bar table makes it really hard to even fit one plate of your food with your coffee cup to comfortably eat. It's also tucked inside a random office/commercial building where random people are constantly leaving the door open while wheeling big stuff going in and out. They should at least think of making coat hooked under the bar tables so they're space we hang our jackets & bags while we sit down to eat and enjoy our coffee.

Get this if you're indecisive like me! The scrambled eggs were more like a thin cheese omelette and the biscuits were perfect - not too dry or rich! They were generous with the bacon portion and the jam added a nice sweet touch to this savoury dish. I was pleasantly surprised by this simple dish!  My friend had the Smashing Avocado ($14) and the portion size was bigger than expected! The multigrain toast was packed with a very THICK layer of avocado. My friend said it was good!  Not sure how we feel about the Belgian Waffle ($14). The size of this dish was quite small - just one piece. The waffle was crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside, but not a big fan of the dragonfruit panna cotta on top. It had an over-powering taste and it was too sweet to our liking.

Coffee Clock,4,"This place has a lot of potential but isn't quite there yet. The space is large with a lot of seating - unlike many of the coffee shops in the area.  The coffee itself is fine - there is better coffee in the area but it does the trick. The food menu is pretty limited. They have some baked goods and have recently expanded to have a few hot items. I have been hoping that they expand their menu to include fresh cooked breakfast sandwiches, but haven't seen any indication that they will. They pride themselves on their desserts, which I've tried and wasn't blown away by. I don't think the coffee/dessert combo really works here.  The restaurant is never really crowded, so I would suggest this place if you are looking for somewhere to work or to have a quiet conversation. I've heard they also have a printer you can use.

I have also gone in during the evening a few times to sit and enjoy my coffee. There is a lot of seating which is nice if you want to meet a friend or just sit for a bit. They have mugs etc if you want to enjoy your coffee and/or sweet treat there. I really like that aspect because I hate the waste of a disposable cup if I am not taking my coffee with me.

I got the flower power salad and was very pleasantly surprised to see the insane amount of avocado topping the salad-- there was probably an entire avocado's worth; if not more. However, most of the mixed greens were seriously wilted, to the point where they were seriously shriveled and wrinkled. Perhaps this was a one off thing, as the avocado was certainly quite fresh, but will probably stick to the drinks if I end up coming back next time.",3,6/25/2018,2,1,1,40.73890517,-73.99544205

COFFEED - Chelsea,4,"I was on my way to Adorama when I passed by the newest branch of COFFEED, with a small blackboard outside proudly proclaiming: ""We're (Finally) Open!"". Having been to both the LIC and Astoria locations, I was delighted to see that they were finally in Manhattan and promptly made my way inside. The space isn't completely finished, as several workers were hanging up the final pieces of decor against the walls, so there was the occasional sound of hammering and drilling; but otherwise, everything seemed to be running smoothly.  The interior leans on the smaller side, with a row of 8 or so counter seats against the window and a handful of two tops. I can imagine that the venue will get pretty busy later on, especially as they're located on a well-traversed street, but it's not a bad place to stop in for an hour, plop open the laptop or book, and have a warm beverage or two. COFFEED also has an extensive edible menu available, spanning tempting-sounding breakfast items, sandwiches, and salads - perfect for a lunch stop - or a handful of sugar-infused treats.  I will note that especially in the cold weather, the constant opening and closing of the door can get rather painful - a vestibule would definitely help with this; otherwise, do your best to seat yourself as far away from the door as possible. Also, as the prior review mentioned, the service appears to be across the board. I placed my order for a coffee with a rather sullen-faced cashier who replied to my questions with monosyllabic answers, but was given a bag of chips from a smiling barista, who apologized for the noise and thanked guests for visiting.  I'm hopeful that once COFFEED gets into full operation, they'll work out some of the kinks. Either way, I'll be dropping by again to try something aside from my typical drip coffee... which, by the way, I'm tempted to get seconds on.",3,2/20/2015,12,10,9,40.73890517,-73.99544205

Produce is fresh - I recommend the Jackson Heights salad ($9 for baby spinach, avocado, corn and beans, cotija cheese).  $3 more gets meat or tuna on the salad. $3 more after that gets a Greek yogurt w/chia seed.

I assume that's why he included a little tub of Philadelphia cream cheese in my bag, which was very nice! I suppose this would be a bad thing if you prefer your cream cheese to already be spread on your bagel, but I personally don't care either way.  The coconut green tea was really good.

Dear Mama Coffee,4.5,Have been a regular customer here since the day it opened.  Used to love the espresso.  Recently they changed their espresso and it has been so awful I have had to throw out two lattes in a row.  The first time I thought the milk went bad (hence my return for the second latte).  I really like the staff and the vibe and used to love the espresso but unfortunately if this change is permanent I am going to have to head elsewhere.  The new beans are just bad.,3,9/3/2018,1,0,0,40.792141,-73.940656
Dear Mama Coffee,4.5,"Love the coffee here! I've been here twice alrdy and it's a great place to get work done. There's a lot of space, and the 2 times I've been there, it has never been crowded or busy, then again I'm usually there in off hours. My usual concern is being able to find a seat and table to write. I've only ever has there coffee and a piece of banana bread, they do have a couple menu of sandwiches and salads, but not a place I would do for lunch. I only wish there small circle tables were a been bigger, it's ok if you're sitting solo and sipping coffee, but if you want to put a laptop and a couple of books/notepad/journal out, it's kinda like Tetris. They do have bigger tables, but those are for bigger groups, which I usually try to avoid hogging, if it's just myself.

I met with a friend there to get some work done, but it was slightly difficult to find a place with plugs for our laptops. I was lucky enough that someone vacated their table right when I was getting there, so I just plopped my stuff down and got right to work. There were quite a few people there, which made it quite difficult to find spots anyway (this was Saturday afternoon, slightly after 11). It was also a bit cold inside, so I did end up having to wear a thicker jacket.  It was easy to order, and there seemed to be a good selection of pastries. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try them. I got some coffee and later, because I was a little hungry, got a sandwich. The sandwich was really expensive! I do not recommend the food there--it's decent food, but on the pricey side.  TL;DR: This location is worth going to, but if you're trying to study there and have study habits like me where you have to buy some coffee or snacks while you're studying, it may be slightly expensive if you're trying to spend an entire day there.",3,3/1/2018,0,0,0,40.7675191,-73.9893618
FIKA,4,"While I want to leave a better review for this location because it's my everyday go-to for the past few years...I'm stunned at how dirty its become. Literal filth. I don't think they sweep or mop that place but once a month. The cloth chairs are completely stained and you're hesitant to sit on them. I don't ever want to bring people here for a coffee chat because it's so utterly gross to sit in. The amount of crumbs, dust, and hair on the floor are enough to make this place seem icky like it should have a B rating. And judging by the cost of coffee, you would think they could afford cleaning supplies.  The staff is 50/50 when it comes to you feeling like you're inconveniencing them for wanting to order a coffee or anything in general. Especially the guy in the morning with the long beard. He couldn't be less interested or more rude.  If they would clean the place daily and have employees that were nice- it would be more inviting. My recommendation: go to Rex up the street.

FIKA,4,"3.5/5  I was looking for a coffee shop to do some work in, and I happened to see that this FIKA is nearby. I've always appreciated the care FIKA gave to developing its coffee spaces (plus the coffee is decent), so I opted to check out this Hell's Kitchen FIKA. I ordered a drip - it's as expected, nothing wowtastic. The space itself is very nice, with two floors and ample natural lighting via a skylight. The internet works well.  BUT  I'm docking 1 star from the otherwise 4.5 star rating, because the staff hasn't kept this beautiful space clean. There is garbage and dirty dishes on tables, crumbs and coffee stains on others.

They don't have any selections of brews, or  offer different preparation methods so you get your classic latte or cappuccinos etc. I think this cafe is more suitable for people who consume dairy! You can find non dairy milk options but that's about it. The almost croissant wasn't flaky, it was a bit stringy after being warmed also the size of the croissant was way too little in comparison to other cafes but not in price.

I cannot emphasize how great the service and quality is here. The iced cappuccino is particularly amazing to me since they managed to get great foam on an iced drink, and I usually get a mushroom pastry that is nice and doughy as well as flaky (which they always heat up). The macarons are delicious too. I've also bought their roasted whole beans to brew my own coffee at home, and they helped me determine which beans to get (I'm new to whole beans). Of course, the beans make fantastic coffee which is so good I drink it black. Finally, the space itself is comfortable and great for studying/computer work/relaxing, and they have wifi.

Everything is much stronger and borders on bitter at times.  Definitely an acquired taste.  I had the caramel latte and it was hard to taste the caramel or anything else but bitter coffee.

Gregory۪s Coffee,4,"Gregory's coffee is an extremely convenient stop on my way to work and I am so thankful that they are open at 6 am because a lot of other shops do not open until 7. I think this is because Gregory's is a chain as opposed to a locally owned shop, nevertheless, it's convenient. However, what's not convenient about Gregory's coffee is the price and the really filthy bathroom. When you come into a coffee shop at 6:15 am and the bathroom is absolutely filthy with a vanity that looks like a gas station bathroom with the most offensive smells, you know that this bathroom was A) not cleaned that morning before opening the shop and B) not cleaned the night before when the staff went home because from 6 am to 615 am I doubt someone went into the bathroom and wrecked it. The gross bathroom is consistent too. Also, there are no hooks to hang your coat or bags in the bathroom so when you go in, you are most certainly not putting anything on the floor so you have to hold your giant purse on your lap, it makes the convenient coffee shop on your way to work, not so convenient.  It's a shame because I think the set up of Gregory's is cool. I like the high top table seating in the entryway. They have a lot of goodies in their food window. Protein balls, fancy toasts, baked goods galore. They also have water bottles, hard boiled eggs and some other things in their refrigerated section. They almost always have bananas on the counter too. They have a house blend, which is what I always get. I think their coffee is a little expensive, however. $3.10 for a medium is steep. I don't know if they are charging me an additional fee for the almond milk I have added, but I always ask for the teeniest drop so now I am curious if that's why the cup seems so expensive. Also, even with a sleeve on the cup, it is very difficult to hold for three avenues, burns my hand and I've been in the restaurant business for years, my nerve endings in my hand are minimal due to burns in the past so if I think the cup is hot, others have to agree tenfold.  So moral of the story is, their coffee is really good, their blend is unique and delicious. If they cleaned their bathroom and added a hook it would make a world of difference. Also a couple smiling faces behind the counter wouldn't be the end of the world.",3,10/20/2017,1,0,2,40.7464872,-73.9825769

Gregorys Coffee,4,"Needed coffee on a break between classes and decided to give this place a try. Very trendy atmosphere that comes through by way of the decor and starbucks-esque menu/prices. There was no line, or any other customer in the shop, for that matter, when I came by around noon on a Wednesday. Every staff member near me behind the counter (there were about three of them) greeted me as I walked up to survey the pastries.  I ordered a vanilla latte and chocolate croissant, both priced at a point that let me know I was on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The croissant was not warmed before it was served to me, but it was still perfectly flaky and delicious (I am not sure if there is a warming option; I did not ask). I watched my barista make my latte with care, taking her time and creating a leaf design in my milk foam. It was the perfect temperature for immediate drinking but tasted mediocre at best.  I have since returned three times and ordered the same drink, and each time I've been disappointed. I guess I just don't like their brew.",3,9/16/2015,0,1,1,40.76646898,-73.96528566

With so many coffee joints in NYC, especially Midtown, Times Sq, and Hell's Kitchen, why would I bother?  Lemme tell you why...  When you walk in the door at 888 8th Ave (an auspiciously lucky number!), you already feel like you're home.  Cool music and friendly, engaging folks behind the counter make you feel welcome.  This was my second trip here in a month (I'm from Chicago) and it's hard to imagine going elsewhere.    Probably my favorite part is watching other customers.  They can feel the vibe, dig the excellent music, and most all break out in song or dance.  Baristas too.  Today, I was greeted by a tall drink of water, Chad.  He was very helpful, made smart suggestions to my broad, random questions (get the egg fritatta on brioche, BTW), and saved me from double dosing on my dirty chai.  Seamless handoff to Olive, the barista with the mostest, where she made a flawless almond milk dirty chai.  It was the PERFECT temp, smooth and balanced, and poured with love.  No, really, check out the heart in my pic.  :-)  Food is top quality as well so don't hesitate to add sweets and savories to your Ground Central experience.

Handcraft Coffee,4,"Let me start by saying I've worked in the specialty coffee industry for over 8 years, so my standards may be above average, but I rarely write bad reviews.  Pros- Nice, clean ambiance. Friendly staff. Solid selection of sourced pastries.  Cons- This place has the look and feel of a specialty grade, third wave shop, but lacks the coffee chops. I've been here on two occasions, the first was on their opening day, and I ordered an espresso. Espresso is, in my opinion, the best way to test a coffee shop, as it's the most difficult to do well. Sadly, I never got to taste the espresso because it was served to me at no less than 230 degrees! I'm not exaggerating when I tell you it was so hot that the roof of my mouth was peeling dead skin for the next 2 day's... Remember this is my profession, I'm very used to drinking espresso and black, fresh coffee so I would dare to say, I have a higher tolerance for heat than most. I've NEVER had an espresso or cup of coffee this hot. Aside from burning the coffee, it destroyed my mouth... I went back a couple days later and asked to speak with the manager, because I believe in addressing ""bad reviews"" with the management first, to give them a chance to explain/apologize/adjust. When I told him my concern I was met with a look of disbelief, and annoyance. No apology was made, no effort to correct, nothing. Just an ""ok"". Fast forward to today, I decided to give the place another shot, and ordered a drip coffee for my wife with 1/2&1/2. I was given a coffee that had steamed whole milk instead? Coffee was a very dark roast, I asked for a medium roast.  Summary- Fancy looks, Good pastries, Bad coffee.

What surprised me was, when I opened the box (they put the toast in a box), there was only the toast. No sides or salad, and still it cost $12.  Overall things here are kinda expensive. The prices of signature drinks are too high for the size. Their toasts, too, have no sides and cost the same as those stores that serve sides.

We had a delicious ""brekkie"" sandwich and avo toast and both were very, very yummy. Fresh bright flavors and very good bread. The dine-in space is a bit small if you're with more than a couple other people -- there are spots outside if it's not super steamy out.

The design includes large high ceilings which reminded me of an upscale log cabin in the woods.  I wouldn't come here for the food. It's pricey (almost $10 for bagel with lox!) and I'd say they're known for their drinks more than a few baked goods. I tried the everything everything bagel (~$3 with cream cheese) and it was alright. I expected it to have a stronger flavor, be warmer, and just overall taste better.  I also cracked and got the green light drink, and considered a special drink inspired by a kpop star called the kookie latte. The green light drink was refreshing and healthy, and surprisingly sweet given the fruits and vegetables it contained. Do it for the 'gram and keep the cute bottle and light--people kept asking where I got it!  Service was alright.

Idea Coffee,4,"I'll admit it. This whole light bulb trend is what got me to try Idea Coffee. I had a very short stop in between my train from CT to Philadelphia so I power walked to Idea Coffee. I purposely checked beforehand to see which items on their menu came in the light bulb. The juices weren't really calling out to be so I opted for the cold brew in the light bulb and it was not cold. Because of the shape of the cup you really can't get ice in there. I wish they pre chilled the cold brew so when they pour it into the light bulb it's actually a 'cold' cold brew. The coffee was dark and fragrant. But it was also pricey. I can't speak for the other items on the menu though.  The interior is great; plenty of seating, modern, spacious, and free wifi. They also have a food menu so this is a solid cafe. I think this is a great spot for studying while sipping on a coffee and pastry. Honestly speaking, this was a place I wanted to hit up to get it 'out of my system.' I saw these light bulb cups everywhere and just wanted to get one.

Idea Coffee,4,"Oh, how happy I am to have stumbled upon this place.  This is my new favorite spot!  Very cute place with adequate seating.  It's nice that there are a variety of seating choices as well - benched tables, smaller tables, bar seating against the window, etc.  The lighting is variable as well, so I'm sure it can cater to anyone's needs.  I love the feel of this place!  So, while I've only been here twice so far, it's been quite pleasant both times.  The people taking orders are nice, particularly the guy that works up front with the longer hair.  Food and drink always come out in a timely manner, and they seem to be sure to announce that your order is ready twice right off the bat so you'll know it's there to grab.    Ah the food and drink ^-^ Macarons : Best S'mores macaron I've ever had - and I've had my fair share.  Wonderful surprise in the middle, unlike others I've had ( where I expected it and was disappointed each time).  The Matcha macaron had a very delicate flavor, but great nonetheless.  The Pistachio macaron was just okay - it didn't really have many hints, and I would really have loved to experience more of that nutty element. Everything Bagel Toasted w Cream Cheese : Oh my geezus, this place sure doesn't skimp on the cream cheese! Fantastic.  Just how I like it lol There's seriously nothing worse than getting a bagel, and getting the tiniest amount of spread, and my mouth becoming a desert.  So, thank goodness this place doesn't make me suffer.  The bagel itself was delicious - actually one of the better bagels I've had in New York...go figure. Savory Cheese and Bacon Waffle : Need I say more?? The waffle itself is so nice and buttery; reminds me of a croissant, only much more dense.  It was sprinkled with chopped up bacon, melted shredded cheese, parsley (?), and these bigger sugar granules which gave a great texture change and touch of sweetness.  Amazing. Iced Matcha Latte : This was a little light on the matcha flavor, so I do wish it was a bit more robust.  However, it is still a wonderfully refreshing drink, and the milk seemed a bit frothy which was nice! Yellow Light : Ah ha, the light bulb drink!  First of all, can we talk about the cute light bulb bottle/cup it comes in?  WITH a working light and bendy straw.  On point. The drink itself was fantastic as well.  Fruity, cool, refreshing.  Seriously, an awesome drink to brighten your day figuratively and literally. Plus, you get to take the bulb home ^-^  I shall certainly keep coming back and filling up that drink card of theirs (another perk. who doesn't love those things?) Definitely recommend giving this place a try!!",3,9/15/2016,3,0,0,40.7447398,-73.98726
Idea Coffee,4,"Came here for the light bulb drink. There were 3 flavors- red light, yellow light, and green light. I think the cold brew also comes in a light bulb if you ask for it. I got the red light, which was a pomegranate drink with beets. The beets flavor was really strong, it tasted like a juice that you would get at a pressed juicery. The price was $7 for a lightbulb drink, which came with a straw and a light. The juice was great, but it was pretty pricey for a drink though. I would probably get something else if I were to come back again.",3,6/1/2017,0,0,1,40.7447398,-73.98726

I ordered Nordic Bowl which had only tiny piece of salmon, lettuce, onion and tomatoes.. $15. Regular packet tea was $4. The bowl tasted so plain and I was starving after eating it. Not sure why is it so expensive when it had nothing inside. I definitely would not order that bowl again. I honestly though bowl means they put something inside, like rice or barley.

In̬s,4.5,"I think In̬s has some promise.  I was attracted by the variety of healthy breakfast options.  I chose the Healthy Start bowl.  I liked it but I did not love it.  The bowl contained couscous, arugula, cucumber, radish, carrot, cabbages, avocado, and scrambled eggs.  The eggs were the best part: soft, well-seasoned, and luscious.  The half avocado was ripe, soft, and a generous size.  I was surprised that the couscous was cold.  I was expecting more warmth to the bowl.  The eggs were the knot warm component.  The bowl started out tasty but once the eggs ran out it moved into make-me-feel-like-a-cow-territory with too much chewing of raw veg too early in the morning.  I did not finish my bowl.

In̬s,4.5,"Come for the coffee, avoid the food and matcha. The service is really what shines at In̬s. I ordered the americano, matcha latte, bacon egg and cheese, and the avocado toast. The americano was really good; I'd order it again. They use a good Colombian bean. The matcha latte needed some honey/sweetener.  Onto the food. Other people's reviews mention the star of the bacon egg and cheese was the bread, but I didn't think so. The egg was too salty; the cook should taste it first. The egg shouldn't require much salt since the salty bacon is piled right on top. For $9, avocado toast was minuscule. The taste was good, but I'd recommend a tad more acid and maybe some chili flakes to really spice up the dish and take it to a new level.  Overall, I'd say this is a decent place if you're in the area, but lately there have been a lot more places popping up around the UES that I would recommend over In̬s. The price at In̬s does not justify the quality of the food you receive. Stick to the coffee.",3,4/21/2018,0,0,0,40.7688743,-73.9540719
In̬s,4.5,It wasnt yucky here but it wasn't spectacular either. The food here speaks for itself. You taste what you order. I got the healthy start bowl and it literally was a bunch of veggies nicely plated into a bowl. It's not like the flavors blended well together. I just had a bowl of raw veggies and that what made it healthy but not flavorful. My husband got the croque madame. He thought that they went heavy duty on the cheese which made the dish really greasy. It's mostly what we tasted despite the egg and ham that was also in the sandwich. We did get the chai latte which was nice since it wasn't overly sweet for our taste. Maybe we shouldve got more coffee here?

Intelligentsia Coffee,4,"I'll admit I was craving Intelligentsia after watching Jerry Seinfeld's episode of Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee with Bill Burr. This location is very swanky and in the lobby of the High Line Hotel, directly in front of you as you enter. The pour-over is very smooth and high-quality, and is one of the best I've had in the city. However, it's so expensive that I wouldn't be able to make this a regular spot! A plain coffee was more than $4, double its counterparts nearby. The cappuccino is also more than $5, and the portion you get is very limited (a bit bigger than a typical espresso).    Seating is limited here. And because of that, when others grab a seat, it'll take forever for them to leave. There are a couple couches and four or so stools by the counter, so once you grab space, snatch it up. Otherwise, you'll be waiting endlessly!

Intelligentsia Coffee,4,"The coffee is always a hit, but the baristas are sometimes amiss. For the past few years, if I'm not brewing coffee at home nearby, I'm grabbing an Intelligentsia honey latte at the Highline Hotel. A honey latte is your typical latte with honey drizzled at the bottom before the latte is prepared. It's a perfect, natural sweetener and complement to Intelligentsia's coffee, and I would grab one enough that I knew the welcoming barista's names and they knew my order a couple of years ago.  However, in my second to last recent visit, I grabbed coffee and pastries with a friend, and the small blonde barista was not friendly, flat out ignored any ""good morning"", ""thank you"", and despite being spoken to and smiled at, did not engage.  In my last visit, a different barista taking my order claimed that they do not make honey lattes and pointed to the honey on their counter, instructing that I could pour in honey myself if I wanted. I am by no means needy or so much of a diva that I can't pour my own honey, but for the past 4-5 years, other baristas had no problem pouring the honey beforehand.  Perhaps both times I arrived, I received the brunt of a post-morning rush, but the friendly faces that I once encountered while treating myself to a sweet coffee are no longer there and I now leave with a bitter taste.",3,8/24/2018,1,0,0,40.745962,-74.0049928
Intelligentsia Coffee,4,"OVERALL MEH: The architectural designs here make it an unique experience but the coffee or hot chocolate were disappointing. Overall I don't recommend.  ENVIRONMENT: the cafe is located on the first floor of the High Line Hotel. On the outside, this hotel looks like an ancient architecture. The brick wall interior exudes a medieval feel. The inside space is a little crowded with hotel guests and visitors. As a result, it can be difficult to find a seat on the couch. Not having many tables or individual seats - so only come if you are looking for a casual setting.  COFFEE: We ordered a hot chocolate and a latte and waited for over 10mins. There's a long line of customers as mentioned earlier. The latte doesn't taste like coffee because they added a lot of milk, but if that's what you like then it's good.

As I stifled an OMG at the grim specter of DEAD baked goods, the barista snatched the cake keeper away.  She towered over me as she sneered ""We just cant have people going through the pastries!"" going through?... I lifted the lid!  Fine.  I left.

Intelligentsia Coffee,4,"Wow, I wish I found this place years ago!! Intelligentsia Coffee is my new favorite place to hang out during the day and get some work done.  Tucked into the High Line Hotel, this place is an absolute gem for so many reasons.    First off, the name is super cool.  Intelligentsia? Yes...love it!  Second, the indoor space is tiny but also has comfy couches and cool decor that makes it cozy and a great place to sip on a coffee (or green tea, which is my preference; whatever floats your boat) while you're banging away on the keys of your laptop.  Third, the WiFi actually works very well, which doesn't sound like a big deal, but I've experienced crappy WiFi at different coffee shops around the city numerous times and when you can't get any work done as a result and have to change venues, it becomes a very big deal! Ok, that was a long sentence.  Let's move on.    Fourth, and best of all, there are two outdoor patios that you can choose from.  At the front of the hotel, there is a lovely patio complete with very comfortable seating, patio umbrellas to shade you from the sun if you so please, and lots of trees that makes it feel like an oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  The patio actually belongs to the Alta Linea restaurant (serving Italian cuisine starting at 5pm), but there's an Intelligentsia Coffee truck parked in the patio where you can get your caffeine fix (or you can just walk inside to the actual coffee shop).  At the back of the hotel is another large patio surrounded by two large red brick buildings reminiscent of those you see at college campuses.  The ""backyard"" patio also does a good job of whisking you away from the concrete jungle because there is lots of greenery and it is insulated from the street, so it feels warm and welcoming.  Fifth, the folks that come to Intelligentsia seem interesting and diverse.  Let's not kid ourselves...people watching is fun.  And Intelligentsia has cool people coming through to chat, work, read, or just relax, which makes the atmosphere all that much more entertaining.  Intelligentsia is the place to be.

Not too many options, but everything looks very healthy and organic, and the prices were pretty high because of it.  I ordered the avocado toast, my friends had the yogurt with berries and granola, breakfast burrito, coffee, latte, and cappuccino. They had forgotten to give us the cappuccino so they gave us a free item card, which my friend used to get an iced coffee.  For the price (~$9), my avocado toast was average--i've had better for cheaper. I've even made better for cheaper. The toast itself was really thick and there was too little avocado for the size of the toast (and the price). I liked the feta and pickled onions, not a fan of the seeds though.

The literal only thing is that the toast killed me man. I might just not be sophisticated for a milk&honey smoked toast. It tasted really Smokey, like it was burnt but the after taste of it and the ""in season"" fruit were so hard. I guess I shouldn't try to eat fruit in the winter, but it was torture to finish it.

The coffee is lightly roasted and the espresso is undercooked. The sourness of their coffee can be tasted even when litigiously hot--a bad sign.  The coffee is mediocre at best, but the staff I experienced there on this one particular morning was fun.  There was a blue-haired barrister, overweight--clothing non-designer. She had a septum piercing and some tattoos. Her conversation with her co-workers were about the maleness of the indie rock scene, and how POC (people of color) are underrepresented in the scene. As a black man from Michigan, this made me feel uncomfortable. Let me shelve my race card and instead play the snowflake badge. I need a safe space. This hurt my feelings. It's no wonder my espresso came out sour... a bitter, sour-grapes chewing, Vagina Monologue reciting third-wave feminist milked it from the machine.

It may be too quiet for a date or meeting of some sort, as everyone around would be able to hear you, and for me, that'd get awkward.

Kahve,4,"If you want the most chemically infused, cancer-inducing coffee, with the worst service imaginable, look no further.  I bought a cup of their house drip to try it out, and after a few sips, tasted not only the acidity of their ""coffee"", but what can only be described as a mild dose of Ajax mixed in, just for flavor.  Sure, bad coffee I can deal with, but after a few minutes, I began to feel the burn all the way down to my stomach and decided to approach the barista (asshole) to get a new cup. When I did, I was told the coffee ""was made the way we were shown"", turned around, and refused to even offer a different drink in exchange.  Won't come back, don't come here. I can deal with bad coffee if the service is decent, but I'd prefer to not drink your cleaning product because your staff is too busy checking themselves in the mirror to make sure the customers are happy (actual interaction.)",3,5/15/2017,2,0,0,40.762817,-73.993499
Kahve,4,"I try to avoid leaving bad reviews, but sometimes it's just necessary. This place makes one want to move to L.A., if only for the classiness of even their scrappiest coffee houses (and I write as a LONG-time New Yorker). Even if you choose to ignore the horrid ""view"" outside this joint (not necessarily their fault, though one need only call the city to request trees be planted), and take into consideration that the coffee, and basically all offerings here, are fine (hence the extra star), what you can't ignore, and what is far from fine, even a teensy bit fine, is the staff. They seem to think one need be sour just because one happens to work in New York City.  Eff that. Hell's Kitchen has plenty of alternatives for your coffee fix.",3,6/4/2017,1,0,0,40.762817,-73.993499
Kahve,4,Khave was the only coffee shop in the area that stood out from our preliminary yelp search. The ambiance is extremely fun with pink neon accents and a mirror running the length of one wall making the tiny space feel a bit larger. The selection is pretty standard but the coffee is very tasty; making it apparent they use quality beans. You can also get alcohol here with certain times offering a happy hour.

Both had truffle oil drizzled over the arugula.  They were amazing!  Add to it the nice chill jazz music in the background and it was the perfect Saturday morning.

Kaigo Coffee Room,4.5,This review is for 4.5 stars.  Nice little coffee bar off to the side of a dirty street. About 6 tables line the tiny restaurant. They have the typical brews as well as some interesting like matcha and black sesame lattes. We went with a black sesame and a pomegranate iced tea. Together they were under $9 which is quite reasonable. Really fast service and tasted great. I would come back to try a classic coffee for sure.,3,5/26/2018,1,0,1,40.71870298,-74.00047254

Pop in for a breather as you battle the afternoon heat and sweaty Chinatown crowds, or stay a little while because the drinks are good and the atmosphere is super chill.

They use La Colombe beans as well. The tea I believe is TeaPigs.  I ordered a macchiato and it was delicious. A little more milk than I'm used to, I think it was technically a cortado - but it was great nonetheless. The milk texture was on point, and the espresso was strong, tasted like caramel and vanilla.

Kaigo Coffee Room,4.5,"Stumbled upon this place when I was walking towards soho around 2pm. Place looks really neat. You can see a display of two massive Kyoto Drip towers and can't help but to appreciate the beauty of it. There's also a signature coffee they have on the menu named ""Kyoto Rose coffee"" which caught my attention but they ran out. Totally fine I get that, coffee shops sometimes just sell out on certain items.  What also caught my eye is their pour over station. Since on the menu it said pour over is available from 12pm - 6pm I thought I would be able to order this no problem since there was no one in line and the place was fairly empty at the time as well. The barista said ""we're not doing any pour over drinks at this time."" I asked ""why not?"" And I never got a response.. weird. I was shocked to say the least. Definitely not a good impression of this place with the horrible service since it's my first time here. So I ended up getting a drip coffee instead. The coffee is good but terrible service.

Hues of dark red, with specks of warm chandelier lighting make it perfect for dates, not so family friendly haha  To be honest I thought it would be a larger venue but I liked their couches anyhow.

Knave,3.5,"Located inside the hotel, Knave admittedly has an incredibly unique interior.  Entering its nook is like setting foot inside some Gothic cathedral.  But I'm uneasy about overly quiet spaces, and this one was practically as silent as a tomb.  For such high prices, the coffee options were extremely limited.  And the barista certainly turned his nose up at me when I asked for vanilla in my latte.  It's definitely the ""we don't wish to serve artificial sweeteners of any kind - how dare you"" kind of vibe.    If the caffeine choices are slim, then call the food items severely slim.  I got stuck with a dry, possibly day-old (?) chocolate croissant, but ended up stealing bites of my mom's blueberry muffin: moist, with an unexpectedly pleasant tang.    Maybe it'd be different if Knave was the place around for miles, but NYC is practically a breeding ground for coffee spots.

Knave,3.5,"Not only is it a business operating in a public space that discriminates against people with a normal income, but they charge you $20+ for mediocre cocktails made with muddled rotten fruit. Also you are paying astronomical prices for sub par products in an environment that is not only infested with vermin like roaches and mice but a mismanaged team of people who only care about themselves than about the guests experience. They don't clean the glassware, the $22 glasses of wine always have lip stains- gross! Personally I only like to pay for quality. I was a former employee as Steven P. Has pointed out, but I am not guilty of low quality because I have and always will have high standards which were not appreciated what so ever during my employment which is a whole another review on Glassdoor isn't it?!

The hot chocolate was Valrhona, melted in a mug, and served with a side of steaming milk.  We also ordered hot cider, which was as perfect as can be.  The music was muted and the service was very efficient and attentive.  I actually enjoyed those fried olives,which were served along with mixed nuts as snacks.

Le Caf̩ Coffee,4.5,"MealPal here today, picked up mere 30mins ago, I can already review it because I finished the tiny little Pastrami Break (a.k.a. bagel with two, too-thin slices of pastrami) in the few minutes it took to walk back to the office. No way shall I ever try this bad value again. The ingredients were alright in freshness though pastrami's not hard to keep ""fresh"" and the bagel quality was alright compared to my favorite bagel place in Midwood. The horseradish is so inexpensive a way they can gussy up what is a too-small item. Pastrami itself was normal, nothing to write home about, it actually worsens the pastrami craving which sent me here at all because the portion size is totally insufficient. It's the worst fear of MealPal: paltry item with chronically under-whelming portion size. I'll note this in the daily MealPal last-meal survey.  The store space is heavily air conditioned with bright cute decorations through the tiny space, must be just 80 ft2 of standing room in there, the bulk of it is for their kitchen and storage space behind the scenes.

In a half block radius, it's dominated by coffee giants such as Starbucks, Caffe Bene, & previously aesthetically appealing Bourbon Coffee. It's tiny and from the brief conversation I had with the baristas, it's boring... but I like it. Because it's so small, it kept my on-the-go flow going, especially since I like to take my coffee to my gym to stare at all the swimmers. I sound like such a creep.  What really piqued my interest was the Rose Latte. I've been spending time with this girl who's obsessed with rose flavor everything & having seen their promotion, I was caught in their marketing ploy. This is a conspiracy I tell ya'! The Rose Latte was actually a refreshing change of pace from my usual black coffee. It had a subtle bitterness and a light sweetness to it. Definitely something I can see myself drinking in the winter or taking that girl to, assuming of course she gets me something pretty when she comes back from Hawaii.

Le Reveil Coffee,4,"Seeing as this place has one dollar sign yet such high reviews, is close to my family's Airbnb, and is a walk's away from Central Park, it seemed like the perfect place to take my family!  We walked in on Tuesday around 9AM, and luckily there were enough seats for us! I appreciated how each little table had its own glass water bottle for us to pour. We looked at all the pastries and the menu, and I was deciding between a Nutella croissant and a grilled cheese sandwich. Because I was having trouble deciding what I wanted, some people behind us ended up getting 2 Nutella croissants. I had decided I wanted the Nutella croissants, but the employee said they ran out. How does a bakery run out of Nutella croissants at 9AM? Le Reveil Coffee needs to know to make more than just 2 croissants so they don't run out at 9AM. So with this in mind, I ended up ordering the grilled cheese sandwich.  Ready to get my hands and mouth all up in some American and/or Mozzarella cheese, I was disappointed in when I noticed my sandwich had some sad and somewhat unmelted brie cheese in it. It tasted like a sad yet healthy substitute for a grilled cheese sandwich. Not what I wanted at 9AM. They also gave me some salad, which is nice of them, but salad in the morning is not my cup of tea. I got to eat this depressingly healthy meal for ""only"" $10.  If someone comes to Lereveil Coffee, I would suggest coming here for the pastries. My parents ended up eating the almond pastry, and although it was small, they said it was very delicious.

The tea wasn't bitter nor was it too sweet, so I didn't need to add any sugar to it (thank goodness) - the Mushroom grilled cheese was INCREDIBLE! I was starving so my expectations on anything edible was at an all time low, but after one bite the sandwich satisfied my taste buds to a whole new level! The bread was toasted/pressed EXACTLY the way I like it and the grease from the cheese was mouth watering! The smell of the mushrooms were overpowering but in regards to taste, blended perfectly well with the bread and cheese!  I love that there's additional seating in the back! It's super cozy and chill! There's plants, a large painting and even a motorcycle!!!  The staff was lovely and I hope they'll get used to seeing me multiple times a week!!",3,3/24/2017,2,1,1,40.74722707,-73.99100344

Luxamor NYC,4,"Edit: Store reached out to me and asked for my recommendation in terms of how they can improve their service. I went there and they offered to provide me a new drink / dessert to help create a better experience! They definitely have potential to grow and become better. I appreciate the attitude to learn and develop the cafe further!  I saw this cafe everywhere on Instagram and decided to try it. I've never felt so strongly about anything, but I have to say this cafe is absolutely HORRIBLE.  The environment is cute, pastel themed, but it wasn't anything super special. We got 2 desserts, the staff supposedly tells me it's panna cotta for one and coconut chocolate with lemon filling. Both are just DISGUSTING. It tasted so gross, hard, and almost like plastic.  I got a dirty bubbles with the mai tea. It was nasty, the bubbles tasted hard and cold, the tea was just bad. Everything is pre-made and literally I asked for less sugar in my tea and they couldn't even do it. The staff has no clue what's going on and I was so sad that I took my friend here. We both love bubble tea and for the first time ever, we threw out everything after 1 bite.  I would never come back again, this cafe needs A LOT of work",3,3/20/2019,6,3,6,40.7288492,-74.0008394
Luxamor NYC,4,"Oh Luxamor. This place is the fantasy of a certain demographic (points at my picture) on steroids: everything done up in cotton candy pastels, and pretty drinks and desserts. They have some seating in the front area where you order and also a bigger back room with more tables - I had somehow lucked into an hour when the back room was very empty but within a few minutes it filled up. I will say it's a nice place to study and read, especially since (presuming you buy something) you're free to stay for as long as you like. No one from the front counter really comes to the back except to bring in orders.  My nit is that some of the drinks were pretty expensive especially the specialty drinks that run around $7 each, especially since they don't already come with bubbles. I ordered a grapefruit fusion, expecting to be blown away, but it seemed to be just sugary iced tea with slices of grapefruit cut up inside. If you're not into very sweet drinks, I would also ask if maybe they can cut the pumps of syrup or sugar. Bubbles were okay - a little hard to chew. And I agree with another reviewer that it's A LOT of plastic being thrown away; I think they could invest in some good glassware or mugs for the people who take their drinks to stay.  Didn't try any of the desserts or savory food. The ""cheese foam"" item on the menu sounded interesting.",3,2/10/2019,20,5,14,40.7288492,-74.0008394

However, their drink isn't so great in my opinion, I heard lots of good things about their maitai tea but it was way to sweet and the bubble was hard... they literally put old boba in my drink, terrible. My boyfriend got the mango punch and it was also way too sweet, it was overpriced for a mango slush ($7).

Interior design that is pleasing to the eye. Comfortable seats. And lastly...a restroom. *kisses fingers like chef*    (Disclaimer for tall people: The tables and seats in the back are low and perfect for shorties like me [I am 5'3], but may be uncomfortable for you. Luckily, there are a few tall tables with tall stools at the front, also with outlets!)  The drinks are tasty. I tried the signature milk tea and maitai milk.

Maman Nomad,4,"Ok so I stopped by this place to grab a cup of coffee, so disclaimer, this is just based mostly on a quick stop for a Chai Latte.  So I was in NY for business and on the way to my office I decided to stop by and grab a cup of coffee. Normally I am a latte guy but decided to go with a Chai Latte. Unfortunately it did not taste good at all, the spice was overwhelming to the point I could almost not even taste the coffee in it.  The staff were really nice and to be fair I would definitely come back again. They had plenty of seating and really nice decor inside as well.",3,2/14/2019,1,1,1,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4,"I go all over the place with this chain. As everyone mentions, the decor and ambiance are adorable and welcoming. It's like having a tea party with your chic french grandma.  The ordering system is a little awkward if you're eating in. You seat yourself, I forget if me and my friend got menus or were given them. You get up to order your coffee or whatever at the barista station in front, and you get up to order your food from the counter in the back. The food is brought to you, the drinks you get yourself. It's a casual whimsical place, and it wasn't busy so this worked but it feels odd.  Maman, any of them, make one of the best chai lattes I've ever had, ditto for their almond croissants. The chai is heavily spiced, very aromatic, sweet without being a Starbucks syrup bomb. The croissants are generously packed with what I always think of as almond paste, covered with almond slivers, and sprinkled with confectioners sugar. I adore it.  This was my first time sitting down for a meal. My friend ordered the Waffle-iron hashbrowns* with smoked salmon, avocado, cucumber, balsamic mixed greens, lemon, dill & a soft boiled egg. The * indicates the dish is gluten free, which is fine because none of those should have gluten, and everything was delicious, except the hash browns. They were a soggy mess, not crispy, not seasoned, and tasted like they tried to use a healthier potato replacement instead of real potatoes. I don't know what was going on. The other ingredients were great, but with no hash it's a smoked salmon salad.  I ordered their namesake breakfast sandwich: bourbon bacon jam, avocado, roasted tomatoes, topped with a fried egg on a cornmeal focaccia bun. It was good, and I think some people would even say really good, but the jam was too sweet for me. There wasn't really something meaty or savory enough to cut through it, even with the bacon incorporated into it. The avocado, the runny egg, it was just a lot of ooey-gooey textures and sweetness.  I think I like Maman more for their pastries and ambiance than their most substantial fare.",3,12/15/2018,3,0,0,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4,"I was walking to Eataly and passed my a sign that said ""Lavender Honey Latte"". Just by reading this sign I turned around to walk into Maman just to try it. I guess those chalkboard signs really work, huh?  The place itself is so beautiful! If I worked or went to school in the area this would be a great place to sit down with a computer or even to relax or catch up with a friend. There's a lot of seating room and also the wallpaper is so cute!  They have a bunch of regular espresso drinks you would find at a coffee shop with a few fun flavors. The line to order is right by the door which can get really cramped with people walking in and out. There were also people just hovering over that section so it was a little annoying to order because you weren't sure if the hoverers were ordering or not.  When I ordered my drink I go around the corner of their table to wait for my drink. It came out so beautiful with a little heart and cute little lavenders as decor. The lavender looks esthetically pleasing but drinking I was a hassle because it felt like you kept getting attacked by little petals. I liked my drink but I always compare my lavender lattes to the one from Laughing Man which was the best I've ever had but it's also in Tribeca and I don't like traveling that downtown. I'd probably order their regular coffee/espresso drinks to get a better feel of their drinks though next time.",3,10/22/2018,3,0,1,40.7432672,-73.9901338

Maman Nomad,4,"Maman's cookies didn't really need Oprah's endorsement; everyone was already aware of their greatness before they earned a spot on her ""favorite things"" list. If anything, her praise just made their baked goods even fresher, since the increase in demand ultimately led to a larger quantity of cookies leaving their ovens. Of course, the downside to this is that the bakery often sells out well before closing time.  It makes sense, though. The nutty chocolate chip cookie is delicious. In my opinion, its flavor can be attributed to two characteristics: a crispy exterior (particularly the edges) and the inclusion of macadamia nuts. The macadamias are soft and creamy, forming a contrast with the crunchy outside layer. Almonds and walnuts can also be found among the composition, but are rather forgettable when the macadamias are taken into account.  As a whole, the cookie is buttery and slightly salty, due to the combination of the nuts and a little added sea salt. It tastes even better warmed up, when the chocolate chips are partially melted - you know, like in one of those slow-motion cookie breaking Instagram posts.  Stop by any of Maman's six New York locations early in the day and grab yourself a nutty chocolate chip cookie. It might just make your own personal list of favorite things!",3,12/31/2018,0,0,0,40.7432672,-73.9901338

I liked how they were creative with the ingredients of the waffle, but IMO Jackson's Eatery in LIC did a much better job.

I had tried to go to the soho location on New Years Day for that lavender hot chocolate (closed) but now i suppose i can come here! they have the standard pastries and cafe as well as some bites.  The space used to be a vegan restaurant which most definitely failed in this particular neck of the woods. I have more confidence in this being successful here.  I came back and had an amazing avocado tartine (basically avocado toast) with an egg and the lavender hot chocolate. The drinks are up front but the food is in the back so there is a bit of a disconnect when you sit in. I got a lounge-y area by the back which was nice and cozy. It's very warm in here.

Only bummer is they didn't have a GF bread option for all their yummy sandwiches. Oh and also had some vegan and vegetarian options.

MarieBelle,4,"If I were rating on ambiance alone, I would be giving MarieBelle 5 stars. It's a chocolate shop and tea house that makes you want to squeal in girly delight. Pastels, gold gilding, generous free chocolate samples, adorable dainty china.  Me and a friend were participating in this years hot chocolate festival. For a week or two, different businesses in the city offer a specially promoted hot chocolate, and you can go around and try them out. That's what brought us here, but their hot chocolate menu was so extensive that we  just ordered whatever sounded good. The small cups are like something a large doll might drink out of - seemingly minuscule, while the large is served in a normal decorative tea cup.  We tried a classic hot chocolate with nutmeg and cinnamon, a cardamom spiced number, and an chile spiced chocolate. Unfortunately we weren't able to finish any of them. Each one was overwhelmingly rich. When we stirred them, chocolate ""goop"" clung to our spoons, and would stick to the edged of the cups. It tasted and felt like they just served straight up melted chocolate without much to flavor it and it clung to the inside of our mouths, literally hard to swallow. I think sticking to the smaller tea cups will be fine for most, sipping and even sharing with a partner. Really, it was that rich.  Service was beyond sweet and attentive, our server seemed really happy to work there and to take care of us, all smiles!  It's a nice place to come for the experience, and if I find that happening I would just try different menu items.",3,3/27/2019,2,1,2,40.72321077,-74.00245063
MarieBelle,4,"Honestly, I'm torn about this place. I felt partway in a preserved French patisserie and partway in a haunted girl's dream house. There is a small cafe tucked away behind the storefront which lacked the open, dreamy ambiance you would want with French sweets.  Came in on a chilly Autumn day looking for a warming cup of hot chocolate. I got literally...in the form of a $6 mini Dixie-cup sized shooter of basically a semi-solid chocolate bar.

MarieBelle,4,"The flavored chocolates were kind of cool in the beginning, but I'm a fan of Plain Old Good Dark Chocolate. Luckily, you can get this in two forms.  1) hot chocolate mixes - I prefer to buy the refill packages and make them at home. If you can drink a mug of this stuff at full strength, you're not from this planet. Use espresso cups instead. You can tell when the hot chocolate is ready because the color will suddenly deepen and the texture will noticeably thicken.  2) Single origin bars. Sinful in the mouth.

One sip of the Mocha and my mouth was filled with strong dark chocolate flavor with hints of mocha.  The Chocolate Hazelnut was like liquid Nutella- chocolatey, warm and comforting.  The wonderful texture, flavor, and temperature made this the perfect cup of hot chocolate.

Weeks have gone by and the store has still not outreached to me. I hope the owner/manager is reading this. To you, what an awful way to treat a potential customer.

I swear I thought I was in a fragrance, beauty soap, and jewelry store if I don't look closely and see that they are really chocolates. The chocolates are so beautifully design, it almost makes you feel terrible for eating it.  My gf recommended the hot chocolate cuz she had their hot chocolate when MarieBelle had a booth in Bryant Park. It was good, not as strong as Jacque Torres, but I guess I prefer the hot chocolates from wich'craft instead. It was also kinda hard to walk and drink a hot chocolate (we were going to our last chocolate stop) as you need to sip it not pour it in your mouth and burn your tongue (which I did a bit).

Poeple were very nice and I was able to taste one the their basic hot chocolate which was AMAZING!!! To tell you the truth it goes down so slowly in your throat, it is so intense in chocolate that the tasting size portion would be enough. But you haven't gone all the way there to stop at this stage. So I ask for a small (believe me its enough for 2 people) a spicy aztek black chocolate. It is divine but very spicy !!

The product is very much like a dessert and just terrific on flavor, aroma, texture, total chocolate experience. Vosges was very modern, with an interesting white hot chocolate drink. The sit down is not as cozy at MB but very nice. Starbucks, you can skip. Ceci Cela has a nice smooth hot chocolate, it is uncomplicated and has a nice flavor. Devalicious was closed and Cocoa Bar was fun. They have a drink called funky monkey was has a banana flavor. But truly it was the spicy hot chocolate that we liked the most through out the walk.

I've been here 5 times and normally the weekend baristas are very friendly. Today though, everyone had an attitude. My friend asked which milks they offer - normally there is a list at the register but it wasn't there so the cashier had to list them but he acted like it was an inconvenience. We weren't told that certain milks are extra and that is not written anywhere....but I knew.  My friend asked for half macadamia milk and half oat. We were charged for both milks - $.70 and $.50 each. We then asked why and they guy said ""that's just the way it rings up"". Ridiculous! My friend then asked for a cup of milk since she paid for it, so finally the guy acquiesced.  Down from 4 to 3 stars because there is no bathroom and no alternative.

Matto Espresso,4,"I'm not entirely sure I get Matto. I don't mean I don't understand what they do. They're a wannabe Starbucks, attempting to be a hipster kind of New York cool coffee shop (like you might see on ""Friends""), with so-so overpriced cakes and muffins (and sandwiches?!?!), and a less than chill ambience.  We were meeting someone looking to work on a project with us. We got there a bit early. 6 pm on a Wednesday. It was busy, but they had one person behind the counter. He seemed frazzled. Tables were dirty. Place was dirty. It felt very chaotic, unnecessarily.  But there was a table in the back. But it felt less than serene or comfortable. It felt like someone thought let's open a coffee place in Chelsea, but not make it a happy or enjoyable place. It wasn't conducive to a casual cup of coffee with my husband, much less a friend that we were meeting in person for the first time.  I don't see going back.  I'd love an option to Starbucks.

Matto Espresso,4,"Espresso Matto is a good spot to hang out for those long talks with a friend or two. For me, Espresso Matto is simply an easy place to wind down with my friend after our saturday spin classes. There's nothing great about this place aside from the fact that all their items are $2. Their pastries are average, but I must admit I am a fan of their spinach burekas and feta cheese sandwiches - and it's a steal at $2 a piece.  The coffee though? Luckily I am an iced coffee kinda girl as long as I don't have to brave the cold outdoors. Lattes and cold brews are my jam and espresso matto doesn't do a bad job when it comes to their iced drinks. Their hot drinks though? They consistently burn the coffee, burn the milk, and that drink WILL burn your tongue. My weird girlfriend knows this and still orders the hot drinks, and I've witnessed her scorch her tongue before way more than once. I also stupidly scorched mine last week when I decided to try her cappucino. These barristas are clearly not experienced.",3,3/9/2017,2,1,1,40.7431395,-73.9969043

Merriweather Coffee + Kitchen,4,"I was getting done with business nearby, and I was in need of coffee and a snack. I found this place using my Yelp app, so I made my way here. I walked in to this moderately sized coffee shop. It was fairly busy, but the line was not long. I ordered an inced latte, and went with a banana tahini toast. The latte was as expected, although the caffeine content was not as great as I'd like it to be. The toast was delicious, although a bit too sweet for my tastes. The staff here was friendly, as were the other patrons. The place had fans in side the place, as well as an A/C unit. I'm assuming their central A/C was not working, or they were in the middle of installing a new unit. They had one restroom, which was clean, just like the rest of the place. Next time, I'll stick with a black coffee, as it is less likely to be short on the caffeine content. And I'm forgoing any such toast henceforth.",3,8/18/2018,13,9,17,40.7305602,-74.0065341

The first time I had a meeting here, it was perfect. The second time was very.....off-putting. Whoever was doing the dishes that day wanted to make it very clear he was doing the dishes. There was a lot of banging and crashing, I'm surprised nothing broke. My friend and I ended up having to talk over the noise to hear each other. It was pretty ridiculous.

First time I came here I realized they don't sell large coffees (needed a bigger fix that day). This time I was okay with settling for a regular drip and a bran muffin ($6.50 total). The muffin is fantastic - flaky interior and just the right amount of raisins to counter the hearty bran. As for the coffee, was pretty disappointed. Got a big sour taste from the drink that wasn't helped by the milk or sugar at all. If it wasn't for the fact I needed something to wash down the muffin, I probably wouldn't have finished most of it.  Service here is friendly and they keep the busy line moving.

I'm so happy to have such awesome coffee spot in my neighborhood and to be honest, I was a little hesitant to write this review - because even though it's only been open a week or two, every time I go in, this place seems to be busy and selfishly I kind of want it to stay under the radar!

My toast, while not extraordinary, felt like a healthy start to the day and did not leave me feeling sluggish. I did think it was a bit pricey though, considering the portion size...

Ninth Street Espresso,4,"Ninth Street Espresso is situated right next door to the Lombardy and is a walkable distance from the Lexington Ave / 59th St station. It is also connected to the hotel from the lobby if you go past the steakhouse and the salon.  I had the pleasure to visit during a weekend trip to the city and my stay at the hotel gave out complimentary breakfast vouchers for coffee and a pastry. The shop offers a limited selection, which works in their favor of specializing in select pastries. The case held croissants, mufffins, and danishes. Hot and iced coffees/teas with self help to the milk, creamers, sugar, and a few other things.  Having tried the iced coffee, raspberry muffin, and plain croissant, the clear winner in the mix was the muffin! It was moist and minimally sweet, with the flavor of tart raspberries. The croissant was not as flaky to my liking and no offer was made to toast it or warm it up a bit. As for the coffee, as I usually like mine iced and black, I did not favor the taste of it here and had to add milk in it. Not sure why it didn't have a stronger coffee taste but the milk made it better.  Not many people were there on a Sunday morning around 930am but it is kind of in a quiet area with less foot traffic.",3,5/28/2016,0,0,1,40.7608714,-73.9706595

The high quality of their dip solid and consistent with the nutty, citrus notes of their Alphabet City Brazilian beans brings me there every work day.  While they don't change their bean (except for a Nicaraguan bean they sell retail), what they sell is top notch.

Brewed coffee, iced coffee, espresso, and espresso with milk (they also have tea, too). Underneath the cash register, there is a little case of pastries from Balthazar's: plain and almond croissants, danishes, and muffins.  I had the espresso with milk and an almond croissant.  The espresso came with a cute heart art on top - very strong, but very tasty, and probably one of the best espressos I've had!  The almond croissant was also nice, as it was pretty large, had a nice caramelized/crunchy crust with slivers of almond, and it was perfect with the cup of espresso.

This spot is easily the best part of working in the neighborhood, and Ninth Street's coffee is easily one of my favorites by a wide margin. Their strong coffee has powered me through a lot of tough times at work, and they have a fond place in my heart.  Great, friendly staff who get to know you. Great atmosphere. Even the shop is kind of recessed and hidden in plain sight, and is a great place to disappear into right in the middle of Manhattan, whenever you need to hide and get good coffee. (It's very easy to walk right by the shop without noticing it.)  Couple notes: - They are cash only. - The sizes of espresso-based drinks do not impact the price. - There's a triple-shot of espresso in any espresso drink of any size- so the larger you go, the more there is a ratio of milk-to-espresso (or water-to-espresso for Americanos). - They are coffee purists for real- don't come looking for pumpkin spice here- just really, really well made espresso/lattes/cappuccinos, drip, and cold brew.  They invest very little in advertising, and rely strongly on word of mouth. It works. Every person I know who goes here raves about it and gets other people to go. Now I'm doing it.

Noglu,4,"Okay, you know how you get crumbs EVERYWHERE when you eat a Nature Valley Granola bar? Imagine that, but on steroids. I dropped so many crumbs that I became a Disney Princess and somehow summoned a flock of birds to eat my sloppy seconds. I wish I was kidding. I was surrounded by birds.  Noglu and I started off on rocky ground because I had no idea they stopped having table service at 2pm. After that, you can still buy treats from their glass cases or refrigerated selection, but that's it. No menu to order off of. I was thankfully able to snag myself a chicken, arugula, grilled onion and mustard sandwich on GF bread. I say thankfully because my second issue (which is no fault of Noglu) is the stuck-up, entitled customers you have to elbow your way through at this bakery. As I perused my options, someone literally slid their way between me and the case and started CLEANING HOUSE on the sandwiches. Just grabbing stacks of them. As if that wasn't obnoxious enough, another customer tries cutting me in line when I just want to buy my one stinkin' $11 sandwich. I understand that GF food can be hard to come by, but I was about to go Hunger Games on these ladies.  The food was definitely good. Not something I would go out of my way to get again, but not something I regretted buying. I wish I was joking about the crumbs but the bread seriously disintegrates with every bite. As if the birds weren't enough, several dogs also came to investigate. Eat these things at your own risk. I recommend the great outdoors.",3,4/13/2019,0,0,0,40.7838349,-73.9568862

Noglu,4,"I developed a severe wheat allergy about two years ago. It causes my throat to close and I can't breathe. Very serious. And about a month ago, my daughter was diagnosed with Celiac disease. Again, very serious. So finding good gluten-free options is extremely important to me. I was thrilled to discover NoGlu bakery and decided to use them for an Easter order. They are pretty pricey, but due to the severity of our gluten issues, price takes a backseat to safe and delicious food options that allow us to eat like ""normal"" people.  I ordered a large lemon meringue tart for dessert and croissants to enjoy after church on Easter morning. I hadn't eaten a croissant for more than two years and looked forward to it for a full two weeks after placing my order.  Imagine - I'd found gluten-free croissants!!!  On Good Friday, I called to confirm my order and delivery. I asked to add some gluten-free macaroons to my order.  The woman who answered said, ""I'm not sure - we're pretty busy."" Mind you, I'd paid a small fortune for my tart and croissants, not to mention the delivery fee - surely since they regularly serve macaroons, they would comply with this small request from a new, happy-to-have-found-them customer.  After checking, presumably with the baker, she returned to the phone and said, ""Sorry, no!""  I was disappointed, but didn't complain because I was so looking forward to those gluten-free croissants and didn't want to jeopardize their delivery by making a snarky comment.  My order arrived Saturday, as planned. Easter morning too, finally arrived. I ate nothing before church because I knew I had the croissants to look forward to upon my return home. Alas, the NoGlu croissants were NoGood! Stale doesn't begin to describe them. They looked like croissants, though smaller and flatter than the puffy French ones we're used to. These were heavy and hard. Think week old Challah, but not nearly as airy or tasty.  When I opened the tart, I was disappointed to see it had shifted in the box and was way off center on the display disc. There would be no ""oohs and ahhs"" coming from my dinner guests. In fairness, the lemon tart, though nothing much to look at, was delicious.  I'd like to give NoGlu 2 stars for service, 1 for the croissants and disappointing tart presentation. But the lemon tart was damn good, so they're getting a 3 star review.  If you know of really great gluten-free bakeries in NYC, please share. It's not an easy lifestyle - we need to help each other out.  Meanwhile, I wish you safe and delicious gluten-free delicacies, served by pleasant peeps!",3,2/23/2019,0,0,0,40.7838349,-73.9568862
Noglu,4,"Came here on a random afternoon to study, and the location is perfect! They have an upstairs seating area that is quiet and has enough space, along with WiFi. It's next to a window so it's also pleasantly well-lit. The upstairs does close at 5pm, so that would be something to keep in mind. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the coffee- which tasted weirdly peppery to me. They do have a rewards card that they'll punch for you each visit!",3,12/1/2018,0,0,0,40.7838349,-73.9568862

Staff weren't especially helpful.  I would have ordered a coffee to go with it, but they were more concerned about helping two women who came in after me who were more assertive.  It was unclear if I was supposed to help myself from the case in the window and bag my own item or have shop person do it for me.",3,1/16/2019,0,0,0,40.7838349,-73.9568862

Old Country Coffee,4.5,"I love finding hidden gems, and this one almost made it. The coffee and ambience is top notch,  it the food and price were below average. This place should be a 3.5 but we're limited by the whole star system.  Coffee: 5/5 - had the drip coffee and espresso here, both were great. Not over roasted and had subtle chocolate and plum notes.  Food:  3/5 - I checked the refrigerated display and noticed the sandwiches (with bread and croissants) were pre-made and looked less than fresh. I chose the tuna avocado melt and that was a major disappointment. It wasn't toasty or melty, and the tiny amount of avocado was barely detectable. And it cost $10!  Ambience/service: 4/5 - this place is very rustic and cozy in the best way. It's tucked under some scaffolding and hard to spot, and is calm for a place near Hudson yards. Ideal for a quiet convo. The barista was friendly and fast but a little overwhelmed with 10 customers in there.  Price: 2/5 -   $3 for a 12 oz coffee and $10 for a terrible toasted sandwich? It's Manhattan but its not gourmet! This was the worst part of the experience, I felt like they fooled me on price. The food items were not listed with prices, so it came as a surprise when I paid.  Overall, a good spot that could be great if it was cheaper for the food.",3,4/21/2019,0,0,0,40.75445073,-73.99846639
Old Country Coffee,4.5,It was quick stop to grub a cup of cocoa. The small cafe was pretty packed. I was at the javits center but not much around there so ended up there. (The Starbucks in javits was sold all the coffee they had!) They had different kinds of cocoa but I just got a regular one. It was ok. I also got white chocolate and macadamia coockies those are also just ok. The cafe is small but cute and cozy. I will try their coffee next time.,3,3/16/2019,0,0,0,40.75445073,-73.99846639
Old Country Coffee,4.5,"Based on my experience this probably should be a lesser star rating, but the place has such charm that I know in my heart if my order was different I could have been much more satisfied. I hope.  I saw this pop up in my yelp search for coffee spots near the north end of the High Line. Even the name sounds adorable. The inside is truly ""Old Country"" as opposed to most modern looking coffee shops popping up all over. 3 reviewers claim the cold brew is awesome. They are either liars or something has drastically changed in the recipe since their reviews. Or they like bean water. I took a sip, it filled my soul and my stomach with sorrow, I took another sip to be sure, and as I approached the nearest trash can, took a third and final sip to be POSITIVE that this was as disappointing as I knew in my head it was...and tossed a 90% full cup of iced coffee right in the garbage. It was flavorless and sad.  Service was flat as well. I can handle that, though.  Like I said...something about the place is leaving me with a hint of hope. I will re-review when I'm back on caffeinated beverages w/ anything that contains sugar. But for now, very eh.",3,2/18/2019,0,0,0,40.75445073,-73.99846639

Old Country Coffee,4.5,"Came here around 1pm on a Saturday with my boyfriend. Cute colorful decor as you walk in. Small cozy place, like most cafes. We ordered the Nutella hot chocolate (WOW!), chai latte (a nice light and toasty chai), an everything bagel with cheese and ham, and then the same bagel but with turkey. They were out of croissants which was a bummer, so we had to take the bagel route. The bagels were toasted and tasty at least. I deducted a point from being skimpy on the bagel fillings. There was like one tiny slice of ham / turkey. I also deducted a point for lack of seating. I ended up sitting near the bathroom. Not too comfortable unless you happen to get one of the leather chairs. Otherwise you're stuck with a tiny wooden chair. Better off getting your stuff to go.

Old Country Coffee,4.5,"I stumbled upon Old Country Coffee and it's a cute spot that you wouldn't expect to find hidden this far west on 34th street.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They have baked goods like chocolate cake and lemon tarts, that all look delicious. They offer a couple of savory options like sandwiches. I originally stumbled in looking for breakfast food (eggs, not to be found). It was so cute inside and inviting that I had to go back to check out their offering.  So far I've only had drinks, and while they are a bit pricey I dig what they put out. First drink was a hot island joy. Their take on dark hot chocolate (YES they have hot chocolate) with almond and coconut flavor. Good and tasty but I would try something else after one try.  Next I went for their Iced Mocha and they use 85% dark chocolate. It was damn good and made with almond milk on request. They also have soy, coconut, and cows milk (moooo).  The atmosphere and laid back energy are a big draw especially if you want to chill and read or get some work done.  The interior is decorated with antique items like an old cash register, water pump, studio lights.

Paper Coffee,4.5,"Disappointed.  Was initially excited to check out this schmanzy coffee place with wifi. It was clearly was popular/crowded.  After placing my belongings down, I approached the barista to order a small coffee and matcha. I asked what was in the ham sandwich and (he begrudgingly answered as if I was asking unecesarry questions) there were two kinds: ham and veggie. So I asked again and another barista stepped in and the bill came out to $15 something, and gave a tip after he complimented my nails.  I waited for 10-15 min and wondered where my drinks were so asked about it until I learned that the sandwich was the only thing they placed the order for. It was a medium sized sandwich for $15. I was annoyed and asked them to cancel my order. But the sanwich came out so I said forget it. And one of the baristas said they would comp my matcha. But a third barista ended up double charging me for a coffee and a matcha. Someone had to refund me and then instead of comping the matcha. They comped me for the coffee.  Annoyed I asked to just give me everything and walked away. 30 minutes later, one of the baristas came up to me to give me the receipts reminding me of my (still) wrong charge and a comp card which seemed useless because at this point I didnt plan on returning.    I think what was most disappointing was their initial snark attitude of the 2/3 baristas until they epically messed up my order.  The food and drinks were very good, but was it worth a $15 dining sandwhich experience? Absolutely not. And the service was immature and unrefined relative to the cost and interior.

There isn't much seating but it wasn't very crowded when I got there, so it was a perfect place to get some work done or have a subdued conversation with friends. The location is incredibly convenient.  I didn't try the food but they had some interesting options that I might try in the future if I were in the area.

Small coffee concoctions i.e. latte cost similar. Let's just say - it ain't cheap. For something this expensive, the quality was definitely underwhelming.  Iced (house) coffee tasted a bit diluted and almost too sour for my taste. Iced mocha had a thick layer of undissolved coco power at the bottom.

Pennylane Coffee,4,"I don't want to be a ""hater"" so I give 2 stars rather than only one, but to be honest I stopped going to this place after a few visits.  The lines are long, and you have to wait many minutes if you try to order anything other than just a drip coffee (which is served warm, not hot, and costs $2.50 for a small).   The place is always crowded with UN diplomats and there is never a place to sit.    Other things which make me give 2 stars: the wifi is slow, and maybe it's just me but I get a kind of judgmental attitude from the employees there.  Would it kill them to smile and not act like they're doing me a favor by taking my order?  Another thing which irritates me is that there is a chalkboard outside the place which always has annoying slogans or messages written on it in pretentious handwriting.  At least one of the people working there seems to use the chalkboard as an artistic outlet to express contempt for the people they serve.

Pennylane Coffee,4,So happy to live near a place that serves Stumptown.  Very good coffee.  The baristas know what they're doing.  The pour-over is exceptional and worth the extra cash.  Very trendy yet simple decor.    The place could obviously use more space - don't bother coming during the day to work or sit down.,3,12/5/2013,2,0,0,40.7516071,-73.9701396

Perk Kafe,4.5,"Quaint little place. I live right around the corner so I finally was able to check it out! My friend and I both got the seasonal lattes-- cinnamon brown sugar. In theory, it sounded good but the syrup at the bottom was too thick! It refused to dissolve & every sip was phlegm-like. It was undrinkable, $6 to waste! I was able to transfer my drink to another cup without the syrup on the bottom. I think this drinks works better as a hot drink solely, so the heat can help dissolve the syrup. I will not be ordering that drink again but I will give the coffee another shot! We were at closing time and left with a few free donuts! Made our experience better. Overall I paid $15 for two lattes and a chocolate croissant. Be aware that the fresh pastries might cost more than you would expect....",3,8/28/2018,1,0,0,40.78454012,-73.94710109

Sold out of pastries could be a good thing because it is fresh but it is bad when there isn't enough to go around :(  I bought a donut, almond croissant, latte, and expresso with soy milk coffee. It came out to about 17 and some change. There are also no flavors in the latte.   The upside... there was wifi and the croissant was good. The passion fruit donut was weird but the coffee was good.  Cozy spot but i personally like more in coffee shops I lounge in so though coffee (important for coffee shops...) was good, I'd have to give it three stars for not having more variety.

Perk Kafe,4.5,"I love cute cafes as much as the next person, even more now that my building has decided to start hammering and drilling at the lovely hour of 8 each day. Perk Kafe opens its doors at 7 am (!!), but even on an early Wednesday morning, almost all of the tables were already taken. There's one long communal table to your left when you walk in, two smaller tables to your right, and some stools running along the windows, so not as much space as I had originally thought based on the pictures, but if you come on the early side and you don't mind sitting next to and across from strangers, there's usually a seat.  Perk Kafe boasts the best cold brew but I was feeling boring, so opted for a decaffeinated berry hibiscus tea instead. The coffee menu isn't too extensive and I didn't see any food options other than the standard baked goods, but I'd love to come back and try those pillowy Dough donuts that were the size of my hand.  The guy working the cashier was very nice and warmly greeted everyone who walked in, not just the regulars. This is a dependable neighborhood spot to grab some joe and get some work done or read a book (not sure about chatting here with friends, everyone looked serious about maintaining the quiet), I'd definitely come back.

The chai to milk ratio was spot on, and definitely packed a fragrant punch from the chai spices. The chocolate scone was delicious as well. It was laced with orange zest, which is always a wonderful compliment to chocolate. The scone was also flaky, and definitely worth another purchase.

Pickler,4.5,"I had heard great things about this place and other reviewers really seem to like it, so may have to come back and try my luck with a sandwich. Came here this morning and got an avocado toast on gluten free bread, and I received the saddest, littlest piece of toast I've ever seen. It was TINY. They did put plenty of avocado on it, which I respected, but the flavors were bland and could have used some salt/pepper/lemon. Also wasn't that big of a fan of the liberal application of pumpkin seeds. My experiments with ordering gluten free bread in NYC have been wildly inconsistent, and sad to report that the GF bread here is dry and tasteless. Also got a large orange juice, which was good -- nice and pulpy, just the way I like it.",3,3/29/2019,0,0,0,40.7520969,-73.9721553
Pickler,4.5,"3.5 stars - first time here and I'd like to return before giving it a higher star review.  So the expectation is there but I'd like to have a second taste.  Passed by on a whim - exploring my work hood and wanting to find something different, this caught my eye.  Oddly it shares a building with a local College but the space works.  Limited seating so I took my order to go.  Grabbed an avocado grilled cheese sandwich today.  In it had sliced tomatoes, chunky avocado, jack cheese and grilled on multigrain bread.  By the appearance, I think they grilled my bread too much for my liking (see photo).  So while not as pretty, it tasted great.  Liked that the avocado was a bit chunky and not like a spread, it adds substance.  The tomato was semi thick sliced so again, making it more hearty.  The jack cheese combined with all that, tied it together.  Yum.    I watched the sandwich crafters at work and am thinking a second visit to try the burger and the other grilled cheese that caught my eye - it's a bacon with caramelized onions, two cheeses on sourdough.  Hint of garlic mayo too it says.  You had me at the bacon.    One note about the sandwich, it did get a bit messy to eat so I'm glad I had mine to go.  So I scarfed it down in the privacy of my office with a ton of napkins on hand.  Note:  there's a line but it moved quickly.  There was also a pickle bar where you can grab a few but I couldn't get close enough to take a pic.

The quality of every thing they serve here is amazing. I love the salads because eating the mixed greens tastes like eating straight from an organic garden, the bacon is crisp afffff, they provide plentiful portions, and even all the dressings taste homemade. Be sure to get a sandwich on the pressed sourdough bread- it's so good you'll never want to eat a sandwich from anywhere else ever again.

Pickler,4.5,"Very much enjoyed a trip to this cute little spot during a recent visit to NY. It's a few blocks from Grand Central and a nice break from that hustle and bustle and packed food court.  I went for breakfast and got the egg sandwich BLT. The crispy bacon was so good that I kept eating all of the little crumbles of it that fell off when I bit into the sandwich. I got mine without mayo, so that probably created a more crumbly sandwich than it would've been normally. But still very tasty. Also got a cranberry almond muffin, which was delicious. Not overly sweet, but yummy almond extract flavor in the batter with slivered almonds in top. The cranberries were whole and plump--these weren't diced up craisins, but real juicy berries. Also got a latte and had a tasty breakfast that kept me full until late afternoon.  The staff was also very nice.

They're claim to fame are the pickles, of course, that you can have with an order (one per customer) along with a sample size of they're homemade slaws.  They have a variety of sandwiches with quirky names like The Burn, Hammer, Marilyn and Rachel (ie Turkey Pastrami, Swiss, 1000 Island, Kraut on Rye). They also have a coffee bar and some breakfast items/sandwiches. Coffee is good, not too bitter, I think its from Counter Culture (?) and the bread is always fresh.

The reviews looked great, so I wanted to see for myself what this was.  When you walk in, you will see a coffee shop to your right and the lunch place to your left. I went at around 11:20 and there were maybe 1 or 2 people besides me. So there was no wait! I already had my mind made up with what I wanted to get - the Turkey Club for $9.25 (smoked turkey, pork bacon, pepper jack cheese, avocado mayo, tomato and romaine on sourdough). The sandwich looked smaller than I had anticipated (perhaps because I was so hungry), but later found that it would do the trick to fill me up. The sandwich was really great - but I guess everything that has bacon is defaulted to be great.  I would assume this places could get pretty crowded as you approach noon, so be prepared!

I left a buck in the tip jar, so I broke $20 for a sandwich lunch.  The sammich was pleasant enough, but for $12.40, I'd expect a bit more food. Yes, this is midtown, but we're not reviewing a place with waiter service and outside seating. We're talking takeout. The pickle at the bar was quite good, the admonition to take but one a little annoying. I took the spicy slaw, served in one of those tiny Solo cups meant for dressing. It was only half full, so I received about a teaspoon of slaw. Up to my elbows in slaw I was not.

The left side looked more like a restaurant so i went there only to be told I must order on the other side, no worries that's not a big deal, just a bit confusing.  Ordered the reuben, as that's one of my favorite sandwiches to order no matter where I go.  First bite tasted good, had good flavors, everything in good portions.

The Pickler is truly THE lunch spot in Midtown East - a desperately needed haven you can rely on for consistently delicious, affordable, and speedy bites. I say bites because whenever the sandwich is finished, devoured much too quickly, I conclude it must just be the result of its size being too small rather than my appetite for melted cheese, Sriracha mayo, and avocado being too voracious. The bonus free pickle and slaw is a lovely touch as well. All in all, a welcome, independent, sustainable lunch option that I'll probably see you at every day for the rest of my life, once you get the taste.

They have pretzel buns which is very important (I recommend a make-your-own pretzel panini), great soups, gluten free chicken fingers and pickles with every order! I've probably come every week since they opened. There is just so much try and I haven't been disappointed yet.  I do recommend that they consider chopping their salads.

Pickler,4.5,"Extremely overrated and overpriced. This place seems hyped up when the food is mediocre at best. The energy of the place is a little cold and sterile. The menu is overflowing with options but extremely disorganized and hard to read. I watched them put together my ""craft your own"" tuna sandwich and it was so sloppy and careless, the guy clearly didn't give a damn. I immediately regretted paying 11 bucks for what looked like a five year olds first attempt at sandwich assembly. With such plain, simple ingredients, it tasted way too salty. The iced coffee was gross and watery. Can't believe how high the rating is - what a disappointment!

Love their avocado toast, bacon egg cheese avocado wrap, chicken tender wrap, or turkey brie fig chutney wrap... but I have a feeling you can't go wrong. Portions are not huge but the food is high quality and you get the satisfaction of supporting a relatively new local business. Now my only challenge is to go to work late enough or get out early enough, as Pickler is unfortunately closed on weekends.

Pickler,4.5,"Stopped here for the first time with friends when visiting NYC. We came on a Saturday afternoon (an hour before closing), which we were told is one of their slower days. I love the idea that you can build your own sandwiches, especially due to the fact that they have so many options. Unfortunately they were out of grilled chicken at the time, so I went with their roast beef. I'm not a huge fan of roast beef, but it was very delicious. I would definitely recommend coming here whether it be for lunch or for a quick bite to eat.

Pickler,4.5,"I have so many great things to say about this place, but I will start by saying that they make the best lattes ever. I think I singlehandedly drank half of their cold brew over the summer (which they always had enough of, unlike a certain coffee corporation), and the second it got colder I switched to lattes and I couldn't believe how delicious they were. They brew Counter Culture coffee which I love to no end, and everything is always fresh and clean and everyone is always friendly.",3,11/26/2015,4,4,4,40.7520969,-73.9721553
Pickler,4.5,"I'll update this if necessary.  My one experience was terrific, and it was with something as simple as a tuna sandwich.  It was very easy on the mayo (which I like), the bread was unusually tasty (especially given the sandwich competition in midtown -- endless bland delis), the wide range of choices for pickles and slaw on the side were most welcome.  Clearly this place it aiming to be a notch better than most of the local competition -- much more interesting menu, much better tasting ingredients, though accordingly a bit more expensive.  I'll definitely be going back to try lots of other items.  [Update.  Continued success.  Had a delicious vegetarian sandwich with avocado, hummos, tomato, probably one or two other things.

The prices are great for the area, the food is fresh, the staff is kind and it's clean. There aren't too many places in the area where you can build your own sandwiches (with a pretzel roll as a bread option!) for reasonable prices and get quality food.

Prodigy Coffee,4,"Been to Prodigy Coffee in the Greenwich Village twice now, once in the summer and now in the impending winter season. It's a nice little cafe with seating with tables and chairs for about 7 parties and a bench outside. The prices are comparable to those most non-commercial coffee shops.  Located near the West 4th Street B,D,A,C station which is convenient. The ventilation is a bit of a crap shoot, issues with AC in the summer. And the actual coffee isn't the greatest. The drip coffee leaves your mouth with a bit of a sour taste which these days is really off putting for me. They do play decent tunes which is a plus.

Prodigy Coffee,4,"The smell of coffee drew me into the store but my eyes went straight to the little display they had of sweets from local bakeries. Knowing well I had dinner plans later, I restrained myself and glanced over their drink menu. It was a bit chilly out so I went with an Almond Chai.     My Indian roots couldn't help but get something that was chai with a small hint of almond. It was something hot with a nice fragrant, spicy hint in the milk tea.  I wish they had a few more items on their drinks menu. They make up for it with their revolving specials menu so there's always something new to try. If you're lucky, you might be able to get street parking however the subway might be the way to go. Confused about the Cafe Au Lait or the macchiato? Ask the employee behind the counter! They're a fellow coffee lover and super friendly. After a few hours of doing some work and sipping on hot chai, I made my way to a local bookstore they had around the corner.

My friend order an iced coffee, my cappuccino, and a piece of dessert bread. Everything came out nicely.  Then I sprinkle sugar on my cappuccino and at my first stir, I find a fine, shorter, blond-ish hair (I am asian, not my hair at all) being pulled out of my cappuccino. My friend brought it immediately to the counter. This Asian guy gave an attitude about it. No apology, but an attitude instead!! His exact word was ""I'll make you another one"" and he seemed annoyed.  We wait. Instead of making my cappuccino so I can drink and eat with my friend together, they keep on making drinks for other customers.  I finally got up and waited right at the coffee pick up area. The same asian guy asks after 3 minutes ""can I help you?"" I said ""I'm just waiting for my cappuccino"" he doesn't say anything. And then starts making my drink. He took out the cup and saucer out of the dishwasher-looking thing. I didn't think much of it. The. He hands me my cappuccino. I almost dropped it because the saucer was burning hot. I had to drop it on the counter, grab a piece of napkin and finally brought the cappuccino to my table. He saw all this happening. Didn't say a word. A word of warning was supposed to be there, but there wasn't.  I wanted an apology, and a warning of burning hot cup & saucer, but in return all my friend and I received was the TUDES!

It looks clean and modern, which is also a plus. The one little complaint I had was that the barista seemed angry with me. I don't think I did anything particularly obnoxious or ""dumb."" I mostly just asked about their snake bite beverage. To be fair, that was my first and so far only time there, so it's not a good representation of the baristas are.  As hinted at above, I tried their snake bite. This is an espresso with dark chocolate, no milk. I was really excited to find a place that finally served something like this.

This is my very first time to be blamed by taking pics. And the first staff has asked me what my purpose is. Obviously, the second one didn't hear that and ""questioned"" my purpose again. Even after telling her I was trying to upload pics onto yelp and personal FB, she started to ""teach"" me what I should do first with serious face, not chatted with me nicely!!  WOW!

I didn't know they wanna be prepared...  This is why a potential customer needs yelp. If a reviewer ask for photographing permission first and tell about his purpose, then every store would know he's going to write a review. The store staff would be consciously prepared when they are aware of this. Accordingly, would other yelpers see the reality of a store when every reviewer does so?  I just wanna ask again, ""What would a competitor STEAL from PICTURES of a coffee shop?!"" Pictures would leak the taste secret or any receipt?? Come on..., even so, pictures get help more than hurt!

Prodigy Coffee,4,"I used to work in the west village and this was my go to coffee spot. I might even go as far to say this is my favorite coffee establishment in NYC. As an avid iced coffee drinker, nothing offends me more than a warm coffee in a plastic cup with like 2 melted ice cubes floating around. That was never a problem here; cubes were always above satisfactory. Also, they are literally ALWAYS quick, which is a big thing for me, and never rude or impolite. The coffee tastes great and so far it has been the only brew I've come across to seemingly contain more caffeine than a Starbucks iced, which is awesome for my addiction.

Also they take card.  For us Coffee Junkies: Don't expect a bucket of joe for the large.

One of the girls wanted coffee bc we have been up since 7am exploring this city. We came across Rebel Coffee and checked on YELP to see if it was good. Since it had many good reviews, we decided to try it!  After entering, this  coffee shop reminded me of Starbucks, but more relaxing and home-y.  It is definitely more quiet compared to Starbucks! So, if you need a new place study... this could be the place to do so. The decor of the place is very modern too. The workers were really friendly and nice; good customer service.  I ordered a Macchiato and that was good!!! I am not a big expert when it comes to coffee, but it tasted good to me. My friends also ordered latte, hot chocolate, and mocha.

Recolte,4,"Launched in late-2017 and recently making noise by way of a pending collaboration with Michael Laiskonis it was on Christmas Eve that R̩colte was visited, the Upper West Side space not yet busy having unlocked doors just minutes prior but shelves and racks nonetheless packed with Pastries both familiar and unique.  Owned by Allen Wang of Kung Fu Tea, and designed by Pastry Chef Peng-Chieh Wang, R̩colte offers items built on classic French technique with nod to the East, the use of Japanese Flour one part of the formula but items featuring Yuzu, Matcha and Mandarin also rotating through the lineup based on season.  French for ""harvest,"" a bounty of Breads featuring various types of Grain dominating the right half of 300 Amsterdam Avenue while Desserts reside left, it was progressing down the line that six items were selected to the tally of $20, first bites of an item labeled ""Maple Lover"" finding the Viennoiserie well laminated but not particularly sweet and a bit soft on the exterior while an Almond Croissant was more crisp thanks to baked Frangipane on the surface that was thankfully absent within.  Onward next to Kouign Amann, Wang's version leavened longer than most and thus tall but light with crisp layers throughout, it was on the recommendation of a staff member that ""Caramel Sweetie"" followed, the texture akin to Bread Pudding baked like a Drop Biscuit while Canele were hit and miss, the Dark Chocolate version surprisingly perfect in terms of structure despite a lot of Cocoa while a more traditional version had seen Custard set oddly to create a dense and gummy center.",3,1/13/2019,14,6,10,40.7801595,-73.9807845

The cashier skipped over me even though I had clearly been standing in the line less than 3 feet from her. And she was out of it and not listening because I had to keep saying I wanted some items to go and needed a bag.  As for the food: Elderflower Lemon Tart - looked pretty enough but didn't really taste elderflower. It was just a lemon tart and the lemon curd was good. The tart shell was hard though and I thought the plastic fork was going to break. Metal utensils would be better or a softer tart shell.  Croissant - There was a sign posted about their croissant being rated as ""the best"" or something like that, but I don't remember who gave them that designation. The croissant was just ok. I would have liked more airiness like croissants at other bakeries that I prefer.  Matcha Brioche - I was hoping there was some kind of matcha filling inside but there wasn't. There was a little matcha mixed the brioche bun, but mostly the matcha was the cookie coating (their description) on the top.

We have returned to NYC a year later & so happy to see how successful they are winning best croissants in NYC for 2018.  They use Imported French flour and Japanese flour to creat marvelous breads & Bakery items.   The coffee is excellent as well.

Recolte,4,"The breads and pastries are wonderful but pricey. What sets Recolte apart from places like Breads Bakery, however, is the TOTAL lack of attention to customers. From the time you walk in to the time you leave no one greets you or thanks you. Even when there is no line to check out, you are left standing there forlornly while staff clean counters, chat or do anything other than actually acknowledging your presence. What's really annoying is that management does this, so it's not surprising that the untrained staff follow their example. Interesting that this Asian-run business seems so clueless. I'm Asian and have never seen this lack of customer service in Seoul, Tokyo, Beijing.",3,3/21/2019,1,0,0,40.7801595,-73.9807845
Recolte,4,"While visiting NY I stopped in this cafe to warm up and have some coffee. The selection of pastries and bread is great and looked like it would be delicious but was just so-so. The coffee was fine. But the servers were very unfriendly and rude. I asked if they had soy milk and the cashier said yes, which was nice. But then after my turn the woman who ordered before me (who had an accent) came up and said she had asked for soy also and they told her no. When she asked if they could change hers the woman making the drinks very aggressively said no I'm not making that again. And got angry with this woman for not saying anything sooner, when clearly it was not her fault at all. Then after I finished I was unsure whether I was supposed to clean up my tray or leave it since I didn't see anywhere to put the tray. As they were busy I decided to leave, and one of the workers angrily came up to me and and shoved the tray in my face and very angrily told me to throw it away and where to leave the tray as if it were totally obvious. I can understand that to workers who do this everyday its obvious and annoying. But try to understand that I didn't know, and I felt attacked for making a mistake. Attacked and uncomfortable is is how this cafe made me feel.",3,12/18/2018,0,0,0,40.7801595,-73.9807845

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"SOMEONE NEEDS TO SAY IT! So, why not me. As much as I love coming here and getting there lavender or rose latte ..just realized that the barista on occasion becomes the cashier. When that happens she will touch that screen full of bacteria and then swipe your card. Then proceed to make your order which is fine up to this point BUT once she goes to put her hand inside the glass jugs to put lavender or rose petals it's a health hazard AND flat out *disgusting. - That glass jug overtime gets added bacteria each time she places her hand inside. She's basically sprinkling partial bacteria on your drink. - I also noticed that if you order to stay those mugs or cups are being washed with a rag...that's very likely full of bacteria. I ordered once to stay and avoided it going forward. If you have a business of food or serving beverages *invest in a industrial dishwasher. It will save you washing time etc. - Lastly, those baked goods look unappetizing and stale. I once got a croissant and it was hard/ chew definitely not fresh.

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"Doubling as a cafe and florist, Remi is a fresh change from all the dingy and minimalist coffee shops around NYC.  But I find that it's somewhat a case of the platypus: multiple functions, none of which it's quite an expert at. I've come here to do work, which was short-lived without any outlets; I've come here to buy flowers, which was cumbersome with sitting customers to maneuver around and a staff member who didn't know much about the products and repeatedly had to go back and forth asking a coworker for quotes.  On the other hand, the lattes and the art atop them were just lovely. I'd also be willing to rank this place in the 95th percentile in terms of variety of milk alternatives (who knew macadamias had nipples?!?)

I'm not a very big fan of lavender so I ordered the rose latte with almond milk. The owner/my server was very nice and fast with my order.

Saltwater Coffee,5,"I took a very specific long walk to visit Saltwater. I mean....How many overall 5 star reviews do you see of a place with over 100 reviews?  I LOVE coffee. Not ""sweet coffee type"" drinks. Just strong black coffee (no sugar please). I admit I am a Starbucks bold guy (and any coffee in Italy or Palio Cafe at the Bellagio in Vegas).  I walked into Saltwater and was a bit surprised by how small it was. I mean smaller than my apartment small.  In fact, when I walked up to the counter to order, it looked like an apartment kitchen. That being said, the staff was welcoming and pleasant. There were a couple of people in line in front of me who were ordering the real crazy, creative ""coffee type"" drinks. Since I didn't want a maple, mocha, Chai, cold brew, Matcha, purple, latte with foam on top, I was kind of embarrassed ;) I asked how bold their drip coffee was and they let me sample it, which I appreciate. That's all I had - a small black coffee. It was very good. Not the best ever but very good.  Bottom line: I wouldn't go out of my way, and take another long walk to Saltwater just to get a cup of coffee, but if I'm in the area, I'd probably stop by. If you are into the very crazy ""coffee type"" drinks (coffee and tea), I would stop by Saltwater at least once. That seems to be their specialty.

Schmackary۪s,4,"Begun as an online business in 2011 and moved to a 45h Street Brick and Mortar location by 2015 it is from Nebraska-born Zachary Schmahl that Schmackary's came to New York, the idea to bake Cookies just down the street from Levain intrepid but still paying off over three years later even as other places such have Chip have recently entered the market.  Eponymous for Schmahl's nickname and homey from day one, a small seating area with newspapers just left of the counter lined in Cookies, Muffins, Scones and more, it is immediately on entry that guests are welcomed by tantalizing smells and pleasant service while prices trend lower than average for The Big Apple.  Offering a rotating selection of flavors beginning at 8am daily, the Christmas Holiday yielding two seasonal specials, it was after some debate that six of thirteen Cookies were selected in addition to one Coffee Cake, all of them still warm to touch and the latter moist yet dainty in the form of a Muffin with ribbons of Cinnamon-Sugar and caramelized Pecans adding crunch.  Cozy and surprisingly busy just thirty minutes after opening, many grabbing items to go but some choosing to linger over Coffee, it was progressing left to right from a box that Cookies kicked off with Red Velvet, the crispy edge and soft center textbook while White Chocolate Chips and rustic Cream Cheese Frosting helped balance the Cocoa.  Moving next to Bacon Chocolate Chip and then Mexican Hot Chocolate, both texturally similar from edge-to-center and the former quite salty, it was by way of ""Dirty Peppermint"" that Cayenne was countered before moving on to a glazed Ginngersnap, the use of Black Pepper to magnify Cloves and Ginger frankly brilliant while the Super ""C"" selected by an 11-year-old punched also punched above its weight-class thanks to granules of Sea Salt on top.",3,1/1/2019,10,5,9,40.76015388,-73.99094426

Schmackary۪s,4,"Although Levain and Chip cookies will always reign supreme in my book, I've decided I should be a little open-minded to other cookies. You never know when a dark horse enters the race. I think if I preferred slightly crispier cookies over softer, denser ones, I'd be going to Schmackary's every weekend to carbo-load on the cookie deals they have.  On our first visit, they had a basket of slightly stale cookies in a basket. I think it was 2 cookies for $5 and the variety was pretty impressive. The guy behind the counter was incredibly jovial - he insisted on a fist bump from me and my fianc̩, and said something friendly to every customer. I suppose being in such close proximity to cookies all day will do that to you.  Here are the cookies I've tried: Graceland - PB, banana, and bacon. I thought this was a tad too sugary and the combo of pretty strong ingredients made it really rich to eat in one go.  Classic chocolate chip with sea salt - Delicious. Appreciated they went a little stronger with the salt than most places, as it provided a good balance to the chocolate.  Oatmeal cranberry raisin with some kind of icing - By far the best of the three. I'm usually not a fan of oatmeal raisin as the lesser brother to good old chocolate chip but this version was actually better.  They also have coffee and tea to go with the cookies. Not too much space inside but if you take your cookie to go and munch on it down the street, I guarantee you'll have more than one person enviously eying that cookie.",3,12/3/2018,10,1,4,40.76015388,-73.99094426
Schmackary۪s,4,"Schmackary's is easily one of my top 3 cookie spots in NYC. The service is always friendly, but the line can get insanely long. There's also limited seating, so I'd take these over to gotham market or city kitchen to enjoy these cookies.  The cookies here are pretty close to what you would consider your stereotypical cookies. Chewy but not doughy cookies in the shape of a tradition cookie flavor. My favorite thing about this place is the creative cookie flavors that actually work most 80% of the time. While some of these may be seasonal, my favorites include:  classic chocolate chip, choconut chip, anything pumpkin flavored, and red velvet.  My only complaint here is the line, and especially the way the line system works, which is a fucking nightmare. You have to try to squeeze into this tiny door with people constantly coming in and out and yelling excuse me, and there isn't a well-defined way to stand either once you're inside, so all these tourists look confused and lost most of the time.",3,1/6/2019,0,0,0,40.76015388,-73.99094426

It tastes like double chocolate, a chocolate cookie with chocolate chips. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but it didn't taste like red velvet. The icing wasn't cream-cheesy either.  // Oatmeal Scotch This cookie was amazing! I would happily order more of these! I love oatmeal cookies and oatmeal with butterscotch is a great combo and they executed beautifully.  Both cookies were impressively soft. I ate half of each cookie when I got them and the next morning, the other halves hadn't dried out and were just as delicious. I look forward to trying other cookies when I get the craving.

Schmackary۪s,4,"Long time since my last Schmackary's visit, so I went a little overboard and purchased a four cookies.  Today's Schmackary's menu included two cookies which caught my attention in the Almond Roca and Candied Yam. In addition, right along the display case, is a small bin containing day-old cookies from which I picked a pair of day-old Pumpkin Spice cookies.  Almond Roca (4/5): This cookie lived up to it's namesake as it really tasted like an Almond Roca. Especially reminiscent were the crunch of the Almonds and the buttery sweetness from the Toffee. The laced chocolate drizzle on top just completed the cookie's spot on translation.  Candied Yam: (1/5): This cookie's list of ingredients was so interesting and sounded like a winning combination, but upon my first bite I knew this wasn't to my liking. There was an immediate chewy texture akin to a preserved apricot, which I think were the yams. For me this ruined the rest of the cookie which was pretty pedestrian in flavor with very nondescript cinnamon and brown sugar flavors. Toasted Marshmallow topping was okay, but just made it a bit messy to eat. I ate about 1/4 of the cookie, and the remainder went into the trash.  Pumpkin Spice (3/5): One of this cookie's ingredients is mysteriously labeled ""Autumnal Spices"", and even through the clear plastic wrapping, the smell of this cookie was so strong. This smell translated to its taste which had just a good amount of Pumpkin flavor and a nice amount of cinnamon chips which continued the seasonal flavors of this cookie. The Maple cream cheese frosting laced on top was ok too. Pretty good cookie.",3,11/21/2017,4,0,3,40.76015388,-73.99094426

The cookies are big and I liked three of the four.  The maple bacon cookie was not what I was expecting and this flavor combination works much better in a donut. It had either too much baking powder or soda, which gave it a slightly salty flavor. It also had a strange aftertaste.  The cookies and cream tasted like a brownie, in a good way. The caramel apple crisp was really good. The cereal killer was weird but good.

I feel bad for anyone who brings a box in our office because I can guarantee I will chase them down.",3,2/28/2018,0,0,0,40.76015388,-73.99094426
Schmackary۪s,4,Worth the wait! We waited about 20 minutes outside before it was our turn to order. The cookies are expensive but a decent size that makes it worth the price. They were constantly refreshing the plates with more cookies that were covered in delicious new icing. Great variety and warm! Greasy though so make sure you get plenty of napkins!,3,10/9/2018,0,0,0,40.76015388,-73.99094426
Schmackary۪s,4,"Freshly made cookies every day! They have some interesting flavors. I got 12 cookies for $24, but was it worth it? Not really.  Some of their flavors were overly sweet and salty.

I've had their red velvet cookie and the cookie dough cookie. Both were delicious. Soft with a slight chew to the bite and the flavors were packed with deliciousness, with a hint of salt on it which complemented the sweetness perfectly.

Schmackary۪s,4,"I was greeted at Schmackary's with a very large (older???) crowd this past Saturday night around 11pm.  Interesting, old people want cookies and ice cream sandwiches at 11pm.  We got the confetti cookie and oatmeal (with butterscotch chips) and made it into an ice cream sandwich.  It was super, super sweet.  I loved the oatmeal cookie (wish I got both sides as that).  The confetti cookie was just basically a sugar cookie - nothing special and it has frosting on it, adding to the sugar levels.  Loved the vanilla BEAN (!) ice cream in the middle - though it was a little hard to eat as the ice cream kept oozing out on the sides.  Definitely needs more ice cream in the middle.  Overall, it was a decent after-dinner dessert, but I don't think I would crave it.",3,3/12/2014,3,1,1,40.76015388,-73.99094426
Schmackary۪s,4,"My exhausted, sweaty body needed a sugar kick after spending the day walking around time square so I decided to walk over to Schmackary's since it's just a quick jaunt away from my hotel. Yelpers seem to think this place is the cat's pyjamas so I figured it was worth a shot. I enjoy a good cookie but rarely go out of my way to get them.  First of all, the shop is small but nice and clean. It's decorated with a homey hipster vibe and the staff were all young and surprisingly friendly, especially after I spent most of the day discovering how New Yorkers get their reputation. The kid who helped me was kind and cheery.  I decided to grab 6 cookies so I could take a few home to my family (if they make it that far). So far I've only tried the cookies and cream flavor but it was quite tasty. Moist and sweet. Just what I needed as a pick-me-up! I'm not sure it would be worth a long trip out of your way but it is definitely worth a stop in if you're around the area.",3,9/8/2016,4,3,1,40.76015388,-73.99094426

Not a huge cookie selection, but there are several different options. The salt they add definitely is a very nice touch. You can also ask for your cookie to be warmed up, which I think is almost a must if you are going to be eating it then.

The selection did not sound very appealing for my taste, and so I only picked up two flavors, Chocolate Duet and Caramel Apple Crisp. While I expected to bite into a warm, soft cookie that would melt in my mouth, I bit into a somewhat dry, crunchy (the center was only slightly softer) disappointment.  The flavors were meh as well - the chocolate cookie was too sweet, and apple pieces in oatmeal cookie had no taste at all (where's the delicious tartness of Granny Smith apples?!). Maybe I picked the wrong flavors? Who knows. But I will not be back for a second visit.",3,11/27/2016,1,0,0,40.76015388,-73.99094426

You need a schmack!  I walk into an empty store and tell the girl, well smack me down! (She doesn't smile at my jesting)  I order two cookies for my son and I, The Maple Bacon as well as the Sweet Corn cookie. Now most people would say, really? The most boring flavor in the shop, corn doesn't = dessert and shouldn't be in a cookie!  Hush your mouth!  Corn is something that the American indians have used waaay before we traded them a few blankets for the Island of Manhattan. Are you gonna hate on history?? Besides it sounded different, its made with corn flour / cornmeal, sweet corn and pecans. Sounds like a party to me!  I order a coffee and take a bite of the Maple Bacon cookie. Friggin awesome! Salty, savory and sweet. Makes for a fine and dandy cookie.  The two cookies for $5 bucks is a great deal. Also, don't pass on the coffee. they have a good blend that's roasted locally.

Our personal favorite was the seasonal eggnog (there was only one left), but I was pretty blown away by all of the variety of flavors they had to offer. Only downside to all the good? They sell out pretty quickly, and they have a rotating menu. I went back 2 days later to grab an eggnog cookie to take back to my fam in Miami -- and it wasn't on the menu that day.

On the minus side the lines tend to be long and the store not large enough to accommodate most of the crowd.  However, their Classic (chocolate chip w/ sea salt), Sch'mores, Red Velvet, and Funfetti usually made it worth the wait and crowding.  Sadly, during my two last trips to Schmackary's I left empty-handed after waiting in the line only to find an excess of cookies no one seemed to want (e.g., Maple Bacon, Butterscotch Schmackaroons, and Sweetcorn, etc).

Schmackary۪s,4,"Schmackary's is the reason why I had to do extra time on the treadmill this morning!  We found this cookie shop while on the way to eat dinner after taking in Rock of Ages last night. As it is almost brand spanking new I felt it my duty as a Yelper to check it out as our dessert option. I stuck my head in and asked when they closed and was told midnight. Wow - stays open late and it also gave me a reason to cheat on my diet a bit!  They offer a nice little selection of cookie varieties in a few different sizes. From their modern classics, to seasonal sensations, to other baked treats, and even milkshakes this place is a sweet tooth's delight. Coffee, tea, and espresso is also served here. We were drawn to two cookies that we bought and took home to enjoy with some coffee.  Maple Bacon - which is made with candied bacon, maple syrup, toffee bits, and sea salt.  White Chocolate Cherry Chunker - which is made with white chocolate, Montmorency tart cherries, oats, and cinnamon.  Both were the old-fashioned standard size. I have to say that each cookie stood out on it's own with distinct flavors. The Maple Bacon had a smokey taste to it with a tinge of sweetness and saltiness that helped even out the flavor. The first few bites are odd tasting but as it melts in your mouth the bacon flavor comes through in a subtle way. The Cherry Chunker was just filled with big chunks of ingredients. The cherries they use are delicious and juicy, while the white chocolate helped level out the tartness. Both cookies were moist in the middle with a nice harder crust on the edges - just as I like them - and each were totally devour worthy!  Friendly guys working the counter that answered any questions we had. Only a few high tables to sit at so it's really a grab and go spot. Not the cheapest cookies but worth a try as a once in a while treat. Even a gluten free cookie choice on hand.  Good thing this place is well across town from where I live on the east side, as my inner fattie is trying hard to come back out and temptation like this would be hard to deny!",3,6/9/2012,8,10,10,40.76015388,-73.99094426

Schmackary۪s,4,"I wanted to love this place. I heard so much about Schmackarys and since I live nearby I decided to stop in. I got a peanut butter cookie and a original chocolate chip. First tasted peanut butter, tasted salty and lacked the traditional peanut butter cookie peanut butter taste. Next the chocolate chip cookie.... I ate half because it was so salty. Way saltier than the peanut butter. So salty in fact that after eating bites I had salt crystals in my gums for a bit. I them goggled Schmackarys taste salty and saw tons of others share my experience.  The Maple Bacon which they claim is a favorite, I found to be so bad I threw it out after two bites. For a while I loved the Red Velvet cookies but they don't seem to taste the same twice, they always taste different.  I last had a Funfetti which I have had several times before but the last time I had it it was salty and oily, so oily it upset my stomach.  Glazed Pistachio & Candied Yam lacks flavor.  I like Fluffer Nutter and Caramel Apple Crisp.  I think much of this stores success is 75% tourists and non locals and 25% locals and mostly hype.  If it were in a subarb or any other area other than the theater district, I do not think it would be as successful.  I used to come to this store several times a month, now I have only been there 2 times in 4 months and do not plan to go back anytime soon.  They also do not tell you all the ingredients r calories in the cookies which I think is wrong especially in this day and age f food allergies.

On initial glance, I could already tell that the coffee was underextracted (very light brown color, almost like a tea). Took a sip and it confirmed my findings. Almost tasted like Folgers instant coffee. I could barely discern any flavors notes because of how watered down the coffee was. Waste of money and waste of good beans. Perhaps my experience was an anomaly, but after drinking this, I can honestly say I will not come here again.  TLDR: Espresso is good, coffee is bad here.",3,12/19/2017,4,0,2,40.705318,-73.932418

Croissant was pretty good, nicely sized and light and flaky.  It's a smaller shop with about seating for 14+. Modern minimalist design.

Jasmine tea was strong and refreshing, enough flavor for two cups. They also have pastries and bars. Music is pretty loud, but there are people working on their laptops here. Service is cool.

We came back to the Stone Street Coffee Company today and don't get me wrong, the coffee was still great, but the service - meh. The women behind the counter was rude. Also, they now charge $.75 for the vanilla infused simple syrup. Seriously? $.75? How petty are you that you charge several dollars for a cup of coffee then you feel that you need to charge extra for simple syrup with a vanilla twig in it? The counter person kept chanting it too, taking the bottle out of my hand until I paid for it.  I may have felt better about the $.75 if it came without the attitude but clearly the counterperson was giving that away for free.",3,7/3/2017,7,2,5,40.7435886,-74.0032266

My dear girlfriend and I were walking towards ninth street espresso at Chelsea market when we stumbled upon a place we haven't seen before... This one!! Very small very interesting and also nice because they use their own coffee and let me tell you, it is very good. Now, they reason why I'm sad is because when I ordered my espresso and iced coffee the barista place my espresso in a to go cup, espresso shouldn't be placed in a to go cup... But that was my mutate for not specifying such a terrible act. Now, the barista grabbed a plastic cup and poured straight from the machine, the espresso shot... WHY!!!!!! No one should do that ever... Ever... Not even f it is convenient. Pouring hot contents into plastic is a terrible thing.... Please never do this, that's why I had to give three stars!

Asked twice (clearly each time) about what a couple of the pastries were (since they're labeled with neither name nor price) and chose the maple yam danish (""Danishs (Yam) $4.00""), which was a dense, bland letdown until I reached the yam center, which barely had a hint of maple.

The Coffee Inn,4,Not a big fan of this coffee shop. I got the almond croissant and the iced chai latte and I've definitely had better elsewhere. The croissant tasted a little stale on the outer edges but was moist near the center because there's custard filling in the middle. I saw some reviews that said that there's chocolate in the croissant but mine didn't have...For the chai latte they put A LOT of milk. It ended up tasting like cinnamon spiced milk as opposed to a latte. Ended up paying $8+ for both items. I got the same two items at Madman Espresso and only paid ~$6 AND the almond croissant tasted way better there. Small place with a few chairs and tables if you're dining in.

They have free wifi for their customers- that's almost a standard nowadays but it's worth mentioning.  I think, most people that come here, usually grab things to go. They don't have a public bathroom, which doesn't help when you're drinking caffeinated beverages.  I got iced tea and granola. Iced tea was fresh. Next time I'd like to try their coffee. :)",3,9/10/2016,2,0,1,40.7234639,-73.9885633

Think Coffee,3,This place started off strong and the philosophy / business model is amazing. They support girls going to school overseas and supply feminine care to places they source their coffee overseas. However - the staff really lowered the experience for me. They were all cursing and not really caring who was in the cafe. One was discussing Cardi B and how ugly she is ... in much more profanity. Two other workers were chatting and laughing and she kept dropping the F bomb. Now don't get me wrong - I curse a lot but when you're working you should act a bit more professional.  I also ordered a pour over coffee and saw her pour the water over it ... walk away and not go back. I patiently waited almost 5 minutes (again at this point no one in line) and had to ask if it was ready and she had to go back and pour more water over to fill my cup so basically she just forgot about it.  The coffee itself was very tasty. It was fruit forward like I wanted and i would give the product a solid 4 rating but the staff and lack of attention really gives this a 3 at best.,3,1/1/2019,0,0,1,40.7520507,-74.0015759

Can't speak of the coffee since it was late when I decided to drop by here with a friend for a quick bite. The stars though are for the staff who were very sweet and offered to help my friend who wasn't feeling very well. Very little seating so it's I'm guessing it's more of a grab-and-go type of place.

I tried again this morning and tried to order a pressed egg sandwich, but they were already out by 9:30 AM.  I instead ordered a Spanish latte, avocado toast, and chocolate chip banana muffin.  The avocado toast was okay and I think would be much better with less oil. I would also love the option to put an egg on top.  My Spanish latte was delicious, but tasted more like a regular latte than a Spanish latte.

Think Coffee,3,"Think is a pretty solid coffee shop (plus a few donuts) at the edge of Hudson Yards.  Unlike a couple of Thinks I have been to, this one is pretty small and definitely tight on seating.    This is a good shop to go to if you need a good cup of coffee on the go.  It is not somewhere to linger in my opinion as it is always busy, packed even.  Not a place to work on your novel and stare out the window in peace.  They are tidy and move you along quickly.  This is good if you are in a rush.  The flip-side is that they are a bit curt and not very friendly, but if you need a quick hit of caffeine and then run back to work, this place wil do the job.",3,11/16/2018,1,0,0,40.7520507,-74.0015759

In sum, there is a fairly high standard for base quality. It's just not the last word when it comes to a cafe. All above the items mentioned are good, but anonymous. It's a higher quality version of Starbucks (not many would come for a single origin espresso) and that's fine. Save for the fact that it doesn't have WiFi, I would chose it above Starbucks 100% of the time. There are just so many good options today that I personally would go somewhere else. But I was constrained by location and had to meet a group, so given the circumstances I can't expect much more.

I got intrigued by their stories on the walls explaining their profit sharing with some charity, from my understanding. 10% of profits goes to benefit kids which is always good to see that the business is not always about ""me, me, me, money, money, money"". Prices are little higher than at other places and the coffee is very Ok at best. I ordered a drip  (watery, no real flavor, the cup was leaking). Iced coffee was about the same, ok at best. One turn off is lacking WiFi connection. I understand the desire to flip throughout customers but in this day and age, a loyal customer might be better than the one who would be loyal, if he/she could only connect to the WiFi and hang around with a friend or two.

I've also had the coconut before too. I think the next one on my list will be the hibiscus donut. I recommend getting their cheddar biscuits too. If you love the Red Lobster cheddar biscuits, these are even better (and they're 4x the size!). The only thing I don't like is how they don't heat them up beforehand. They're 10x better when warm and steamy.  I'll be sticking to the coffee shop for now, but if a Starbucks opens soon, I might just go to that instead.",3,8/5/2018,0,0,0,40.7520507,-74.0015759

Think Coffee,3,"We live in the neighborhood. The coffee is fine. Lattes take a while but are decent. However, we will not be visiting anytime soon after this morning. Shortly before 8 AM I went to grab a croissant and some coffee for me and my daughter. The shop had yet to open-The sign on the door said 8 AM, it was 8 AM. A young red headed lady inside kept shooing us away even though they were supposed to be open. No explanation, just wild gesturing from behind the window. I pointed out my watch at which point she deigned to come and open the door. She told us in an exasperated tone that the cooks and baristas had yet to show up. I asked politely if it would it be fine to just buy a croissant and some coffee? She was incredulous at first and then aggressive and rude and unprompted/ started screaming at my nine-year-old child and myself. People who were passing by seemed as shocked and outraged as we were. She might have been on drugs, or perhaps was a lazy young person without the life skills to handle a job. This is 2018. With a million options for where to spend money on things like coffee and breakfast, why would I ever choose a place where the staff are disrespectful, discourteous, with rage and a personality disorder. Especially in the presence of a child. It is unfortunate that the manager wasn't there or I would have a formal complaint. Unacceptable service. We will not return.

Think Coffee,3,"Stopped in this little coffee shop after walking on the High Line for a while with a friend. This was the perfect place to get an iced coffee on a sunny afternoon in NYC! As someone who doesn't go to NYC all that much, I'm not too familiar with the most popular coffee shops in the area. However, after walking down the steps on 30th street to get off of the High Line, I noticed this coffee shop and the outside look of the the place drew me in. This place has a really nice atmosphere with wooden counters and tables and some music playing in the background. We were greeted when we walked in and there were only a couple of people in line ahead of us.  The menu features iced and hot drinks including espresso drinks, coffee, tea, and a selection of bakery goods and pastries. Everything looked really fresh and yummy! Also, this place was spotless...super clean!! For those who do not consume dairy, they also offer almond milk and coconut milk for 75 cents extra. Prices are consistent for the NYC area; my medium iced coffee was $3.75.  The atmosphere was very relaxing and had a modern look to it. I liked the wooden standing tables in the back, but would have preferred stools to sit on or tables with chairs so that's why I gave 4/5 stars. It seems to be a ""to-go"" place but even so, I am either walking with my coffee or sitting down to enjoy it. I don't really see the point in standing inside to drink your coffee but maybe some people prefer that.  The baristas were very nice and there was also a table with sugar and milk to add to your coffee. Overall, I had a pleasant experience here and would definitely stop in again next time I'm in NYC!",3,10/10/2015,1,0,0,40.7520507,-74.0015759

Voyager Espresso,4.5,"To find this little nook you have to actually enter the building and on the right there are a pair of stairs - take it down one flight, make a left and you've arrived. It's a grab and go type of establishment with 2/3 sets of high stools and tables for those who actually have time to sit. So I thought they actually have coffee from Australia but instead the owner is Australian and offers some traditional Aussie drinks like the one I got ""flat white"" with other blends from Columbia and other infamous places.  I grab the flat white and go for it.....yuck! First off it taste like a hot Guinness. I added 3 packets of sugar to the 6oz cup of sadness and it still had a unpleasantly striking taste. I added a brownie and it balanced the taste of the coffee much better than I expected.  I don't think I would be trying a flat white again but it's good to kick my Aussie coffee quest off my bucket list.",3,10/16/2018,0,0,0,40.708897,-74.006676

Voyager Espresso,4.5,"Secretly opened in Dec last year inside the subway station, Voyager espresso has quickly become FiDi's most trendy coffee shops. Owner Aaron Barnard came from Melbourne, which made me want to quickly compare Voyager with Bluestone Lane, another Australian gem in the country.  While Bluestone lane, to my understanding, is a bit more connected with the local culture here, I would say Voyager indeed maintained its unique characteristic, and is looking to work hard on improving it. Two coffees could be brewed at the same time, in such a way that shows how taste and flavor could evolve over time. Simpler coffee drinkers could also find regular espressos.  Just as former sound engineer owner Aaron once said - sound engineering and coffee are quite similar in the way artistic side and scientific side meet, and that's the sole reason he loves coffee. Completely agree, that is also the sole reason I love coffee!",3,8/18/2016,10,7,11,40.708897,-74.006676

Oh my geezus. I can't even begin to express how wonderfully the medley of flavors complemented each other. Not only the flavors, but the textures really worked well too. Everything was so fresh and beautiful. I would definitely go out of my way just to have it again.  That time, I also got a matcha latte- a safer and more reliable option for me. I know what to expect and when one is good vs lacking. This one was wonderful! Plenty of matcha and plentiful serving size. My only critique would be to blend the matcha powder better before adding the rest of the milk. However, being packed w flavor trumped that small detail.  But seriously.

Wattle Cafe,4,"In my never-ending search for a great Saturday brunch, I came across the menu for the Wattle Cafe on a Friday from a client and decided, based on the great items, I was going to give them a try.  Me and several friends headed over there and my first impression was that although it was very small with limited seating, it was well appointed and clean.  The staff were very polite and helpful as we chose our beverages and food items.  I had the green tea latte and the truffled eggs avocado smash (at least I think that was the name!) and both were delicious and very reasonably priced.  The truffled eggs were not greasy and had just enough truffle oil to accent the flavor of the eggs without overpowering them.  The latte was delicious but you have to be careful not to leave with green lips!  My friends had various waffle dishes and everyone enjoyed their choices.  I don't really think you can go wrong with any of the menu items here.  My ONLY suggestion is that they revisit their seating plan, as the food isn't really designed for take out, however it can be challenging to find a seat if you aren't there as a couple or a single.",3,1/11/2018,0,0,0,40.7450472,-73.9782738
Wattle Cafe,4,"LOVE this midcentury modern coffee house with waffles and interesting baked goods.  Apparently the owner, Ana, is one of those essential oils devotees.

No refills and the coffee is so good that you must buy two.  Still, for Murray Hill, this is a bargain breakfast place you actually want to hang out. The music is good (alternates between Sinatra and R and B and jazz).  I happened upon it because my cat was getting a spa day at Walter's Pet Styles (the best groomer /daycare on the East Side!) and it was snowy and slushy.

It starts off as a light dessert but towards the end as the ice cream melts into the frothy espresso it really tastes like a coffee smoothie.  Delicious.

2Beans,4,"After a morning at Starbucks, I decided to have a change of scenery and moved down the street from the mainstream to a nice cafe recommended by my sister's manager. 2Beans not only specializes in coffee, but also in chocolates. Here to study and grab a coffee? Why not also get a few chocolates? Many people were here for meetings or just meeting up on a date.  There are no outlets upstairs, which meant my time would be cut short when my computer died.  There's quite a bit of seating upstairs, while there is nearly no seating downstairs. You aren't allowed to use your laptop at the bar counter, which means there are only two tables you can use your laptop.  I placed an order of a rosewater latte with the server that took so long, that eventually, she also brought me a complimentary raspberry dessert to make up for the slow service. It was pretty nice of her, although I wasn't a huge fan of the cake. I did enjoy the complimentary 2Beans chocolate that each beverage came with.  The rosewater latte was tasty, although as others have mentioned, the rosewater is pretty subtle. But I'm glad, because I'm sure that a strong rose flavor may have come across as soapy. I stayed for a couple of hours, so I ended up ordering a cappuccino, as well.

2Beans,4,"2Beans is both a chocolate/sweets/coffee store as well as a small cafe upstairs that serves everything.  I came here last week for the first time because my mom had a Living Social coupon for two glasses of wine, a chocolate sampler, and a $5 gift card. We had a great time and I would definitely return if we got that deal again -- it's on the pricey side without a discount, but it's a cute place in an otherwise pretty corporate neighborhood.  If you do the Living Social coupon, you can choose glasses of any white/red/rose wine and you get a chocolate sampler, which is five pieces for the two people to split. They asked if we had any allergies, and since we didn't, they brought us their classic sampler (chocolates with hazelnut, ginger, passion fruit, etc.), as well as a knife so that we could split ones that we both wanted to try. They were delicious!  The chocolate selection downstairs is awesome -- a huge cabinet full of truffles in super unique flavors as well as a long wall with various types of interesting bars of chocolates, some $3 and some $20 or more. This is a great place to go if you're looking for a little present for a chocolate lover, a chocolate stocking stuffer, etc. Wide range of brands and price points -- cheapest is 2Beans brand chocolate bars, which are just under $3 each.

Then, I found out there was a whole other floor above this shop. It has a clean, modern layout with a variety of table sizes and chairs. Some seats were comfy, cushiony sofas, but I opted for a seat against the ledge and ordered a macchiato while I studied my GRE.  Surprisingly, there were quite a large flow sitting in around 7/8am. Many seemed like corporate workers with suits and ties while some looked like tourists or travelers as they had a carry on luggage. I mean 2Beans is conveniently located by Grand Central Terminal.  I ordered a macchiato that was served in a sleet, clear glass with a piece of chocolate. It was about $6 with tax and tip. I'd say it's a little more on the pricier side since (I think) coffee is about $4/5 on average in NYC.

It's just as strong as Starbucks coffee for me, but I find that it tastes better. I love their croissants, but I just wish it was bigger in size since croissants are mostly air. I could probably eat 3 no lie... On the other hand, I tried their strawberry hibiscus muffin and it was so sickeningly sweet. The price is a little high in my opinion - $6 for a small hot coffee and a small croissant. The service is also not the best - the guy who poured my coffee today just kind of tossed it on the table and some of it spilled over the lid, which is annoying. You also have to ask for the stoppers, as they don't have it out. Also, their credit card machine needs work - doesn't take chip and it's kind of slow.

2Beans,4,"Met up with a friend at this semi-hidden place for a cup of coffee and was surprised with what I found inside. The place is split into 2 levels, with a coffee bar, chocolates, and various other treats on the first level, while the second level is a sit down full service section.  Sat upstairs, which was roomier than you would expect for a location so close to grand central. The frappe was good, it was not as sweet as I expected, which is a great thing. There is sugar on the table for those of you who need a bit more sugar rush. Each drink was served on a silver platter with a glass of water and a square of house made dark chocolate. Great touch. The chocolate was 72% cocoa and nicely balanced the coffee.  The only thing I would improve was the service, or waitress was a bit slow and was fairly disinterested in us as customers. Lastly, there are no to-go cups if you decided to sit upstairs. Overall good experience.",4,2/25/2017,1,0,0,40.7511373,-73.978866

My macchiato was expertly made and the chocolate sampler was really varied and delicious. My friend's latte was really good as were her petit-fours.  However, it is the the service that keeps this from being a 5 star review.  Although our desserts and coffee came out quickly we were kind of just left be.  Our waitress never asked how everything was, never refilled our water glasses, nothing.  And we had to flag our waitress down at the end to get a check.    All in all, a nice spot to try with delicious coffee, chocolate, and baked goods but probably better suited as a to go option.",4,11/1/2015,0,0,0,40.7511373,-73.978866

2Beans,4,"Coffee combo shop with a step up in presentation.  I needed a place for a quick coffee chat with a friend and 2beans was an option that had nice seating and wasn't your average Starbucks. 2beans fit the bill on Yelp and it sure didn't fail me on the actual day.  Drinks are a little pricier than your average coffee shop but the coffee quality was great. The cappuccino foam was silky soft perfection and so smooth to fold into the coffee. Nothing too extravagant with the latte art, but it had the right balances of creamy, sharp, and aromatic and I didn't need to add anything to it.  Each drink also came with a small packet of dense, cinnamon biscuits. These small niblets packed quite a punch and proved size doesn't matter. They aren't really for dipping but make for something to chew on in between sips. Each tray also came with a glass of water as a palette cleanser, which I thought was pretty classy.  We were able to snag the last open spot in their upstairs seating, so I wouldn't be surprised if it were difficult to find spots during a rush hour. The majority of patrons were also in suits going over documents, so I guess it's a good place to conduct business meetings too?  Either way, it's a nice place for a good cup of coffee if you're willing to shell out a tad more for a nicer presentation.",4,5/24/2017,0,0,0,40.7511373,-73.978866

Quick fast easy reminds me of Starbucks with a little more quickness believe it or not which makes more sense given the local clientele.  For the young techie trying to find some wifi to send out that last proposal, not so ideal. Limited seating downstairs (non full service - full service upstairs) with small tables, limited outlets, real loud.  Cold brew was out and I had to buy stump town in the bottle which's unfortunate also because I grade coffee against Panther Coffee in Miami. No cold brew can touch that in Miami yet but I'm always hopeful and a few has come close.

I guess they made my latte during minute or between signing for my purchase, walking 10 feet to look at the chocolate bar, then coming back. I asked them if they just threw it away, received a puzzled look and was then told they'd make my order again. So they took my order...a few minutes later asked what my order was again, then finally I received my latte. They made it a large for my trouble! ...But used soy instead of milk.

The staff runs around with orders, utterly confused and disinterested in their new customers. Granted, it takes time to get in the flow - ..but first impressions are important -- why not make sure everyone was trained and ready to go on Day 1?   To make matters worse, the place is poorly designed, allocating over 50% of their floor space to retail,  and leaving a narrow and confusing flow pattern for those ordering coffee.  In fact, the chocolate bar within the store was closed this morning, so why the inefficient use of space? Why not combine the areas and make them multi-functional?   In any event, ordering coffee this morning, one queues up behind one of two checkouts, with no clear indication of a line.  Ordering is done through those annoying IPADs, which make little sense for high volume checkouts, especially when the customer has to sign on the screen for ordering a $3 coffee.  Where else do you have to sign for a $3 credit card charge? Certainly not at Starbucks down the street.  I'm hoping this place will get better, as it's convenient and the coffee is genuinely OK.

Bird & Branch,4.5,"I've been here a couple of times, and I do not see the hype. Sure, the place is cute, but it's not practical, as there are few seats. And the coffee is good, but it's not going to blow your mind, as the prices would suggest. $3.50 for coffee... $6 lattes... $6 puddings. It's a bit much. My friend and I spent $17 on a snack, a plain latte, and a black coffee. That's almost two salads.  Almond macadamia nut latte - big portion, but it tastes like a regular old latte.  Black coffee with almond milk - $3.50 for a small cup renders it too much to make it your regular coffee place. It's good coffee, but it doesn't taste that much better than what local cafes offer in the vicinity.  Chia seed pudding - it's not bad. Makes for a good snack. Tastes better when you mix up the red syrup into the chia seeds. But as someone who buys chia seeds and berries regularly, I know it's really overpriced!  I'd come back to try their other lattes if someone were to treat me! Otherwise, it's an A-OK cafe with a sweet couple who owns and runs the place, and I'm glad I've tried it; I'd recommend it if you are looking to splurge on coffee.",4,8/27/2018,8,2,4,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,4.5,"This is my home away from home!  A lot of thought behind the aesthetics (owner-made moss wall!) and the menu. The owners care deeply about coffee, and it's reflected in their consistently good drip coffee, rotated on a weekly basis. However, I adore their specialty drinks, so the challenge is deciding what to have on any given day.  Based on my extensive research to date, things to drink:  Robin: My go-to, an amazing blend of gingery goodness and spices. They use fresh turmeric root, not the powder. It's their version of a chai latte, with deeper flavors. It's delicious hot or iced, and is made with their housemade almond macadamia nut milk (dairy free!).  Sparrow: espresso with house lemon soda and seltzer. This sounded so weird that I didn't get it until like 6 months after. It's possibly the most refreshing and delicious espresso drink you could get for a hot summer day. I highly recommend trying it at least once!  Matcha Latte: I usually order a matcha latte at coffeeshops over coffee, so I've had a decent sampling of them all over NY and at coffee shops when I'm visiting other cities. Hands down, this is the best matcha latte I've ever had. It's got depth of matcha flavor, and the drink itself is so creamy it almost feels decadent. I usually have mine with almond macadamia milk, which adds a creamy nuttiness to the flavor as well.  They use ceremonial grade matcha from Ippodo, and sift the matcha powder. I overheard another customer one morning say that his wife now refuses to order a matcha latte from anywhere else, because the one from Bird & Branch does not have that matcha powder sludge at the bottom of the cup. I completely agree and also find myself unable to enjoy matcha lattes from other places as much. They are usually too watery, and added to menus as an afterthought.  - Mockingbird. This was a seasonal drink where they used kabocha squash, which is a Japanese pumpkin, to create their version of a pumpkin spice latte. It was bomb. I miss it every day.  - Nightingale - Earl grey infused espresso drink! This is really good, Early grey come out strong even though it tends to be a subtle flavor  To eat: -  Kouign amanns: if you've never had one, show yourself a little love and get one - any of their squares: they have matcha, black sesame, and spicy brownie - peanut butter cookie: I find these irresistible. Seriously. The most peanut buttery cookie I've had, dense and moist, chunks of chocolate, hint of salt. So good. - Toasts: the miso hummus and yuzu ricotta toasts are my favorite. Avocado toast is quite good too (it includes seaweed, which adds a kick of umami) - Earl grey shortbread: small shortbread cookie that's perfect for a quick treat  It's fun to see new items pop up on the menu. The owners dream up new ideas, and then work to perfect them before rolling them out. I love being a regular-- the space here peaceful and soothing, an oasis in the heart of Times Square/Hell's Kitchen.",4,1/17/2019,1,0,1,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,4.5,"I ventured to try the black bird. The combination of blackberry and coffee was tempting. The result was ok I guess. I don't like sour coffee anyways, and of course with some black berry syrup the coffee turned quite tart. I was still happy with my drink. It was just not quite my thing. Hubby's mocha was very good. Not too sweet. It's a cute little shop with only around 10 seats. Be prepared to have to take your coffee to go on weekend afternoon.",4,3/5/2019,0,0,0,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,4.5,I love the concept and how unique everything was. The avocado toast looked amazing but I had just had breakfast and wish I hadn't! I had the coffee sampler and the rotation today was not pleasant.  The espresso shot was so sour and too floral to be enjoyable.  The cortado was okay and easier to enjoy.  The ice coffee was pleasant. We added some sugar to help with the acidic after taste.

I am so happy to see this place doing so well so quickly and even if I have to wait in line as they continue to get busier, it is well worth it. Also, try their homemade macadamia milk.

They also have a variety of other espresso drinks and coffee. No cold brew here.  They have a selection of pastries and some are baked in house I believe!  Love the concept and decor of the store. It is like a small and serene getaway from the busy streets of Hell's Kitchen. Lots of natural sunlight in the day time, and cozy seats. Not a ton of seating- maybe seats 10-12?

Bird & Branch,4.5,"If I could sum-up my experience with this Coffee Establishment in one word it would be : ""Breathtaking""  Like the majority of people in NY coffee and tea are one of the most important parts of our lives. I'm sure that we've all gone to numerous coffee shops and have our go to spot for our personal reasons. For me, I've explored a great amount of cafes all around the city and neighboring boroughs from, Grounded (Lower West), The infamous Blue Bottle, Rex, Toby's Estate, etc.  When it comes to rating my favorite coffee establishment, I have three criteria that I always take in account for: Atmosphere, People, and Coffee (of course).  Granted most coffee drinkers only care about the taste of the coffee as that is the purpose of going to that establishment in the first place. BUT, when it comes to coffee culture, its a combination of all three. For any product, we always want to have a good experience going into an establishment; whether that's from an amazing conversation with the barista, a feel good environment to relax and work in, or the jaw dropping taste of their product.  I don't want to sound cliche, but Bird and Branch is the only place that manages to accomplish all those three criteria's.  Atmosphere Walking towards the establishment, you're greeting with this vibrant and inviting sign of Bird & Branch. Outside of the establishment, they were able to set up an endearing, modern outdoor seating area. Walking inside you're greeted with the most amazing staff, and owners Brandon and Faith. The atmosphere inside has a warm, modern, and clean environment tone. From the custom artwork behind the barista bar, the custom round tables, and the comfortable seating with pillows, provide a comfortable environment for work, meeting friends, or small group gatherings. The drink and food selection are laid out neatly and clearly for people to choose from.  People Stepping in to the establishment, you're always greeted with the amazing staff and owners. From talking with them for as short as 5 minutes you could see and hear their passion for coffee and their business. They carefully choose where to get their coffee from and make sure the taste is up to their own standards. In addition, their baristas have a passion for the coffee and tea they create. Watching them make your personalized coffee is an experience in itself. You could see from their delicate movements, and attention to detail that they truly care about the drinks they create. Whether you're by yourself or meeting friends, you will always feel welcome by the amazing staff and owners.  Coffee ""Speechless"" As a disclaimer my go to drink for taste testing purposes is always a shot of espresso. Going into this establishment I was completely comfortable with the menu options. Unlike most coffee shops, I feel a bit overwhelmed with the amount of drinks they offer. But with Bird & Branch I felt joyful looking at the different, and unique drinks they offered. I love their fun, playful drink names that represent a different type of bird and its personality. But before ordering their fun, playful drinks, I of course had to order an espresso. To my fortunate surprise I fell in love with their coffee. They get their beans from Saint Frank Coffee located in California. Their espresso had this subtle sweetness tone, that highlighted the nutty coffee flavor. It had a tiny bit of bitterness, but that was immediately subdued from the aroma and subtle sweetness.  Using the same beans they were able to create the most unique drinks that I have yet to have. One of my absolute favorites during the summertime was the Sparrow which was a shot of espresso, and house made lemon soda. In addition, they made their own almond macadamia nut milk which combined with any of their signature drinks will sure bring out the flavor of the coffee and give your drink a unique and wonderful taste. Finally, every drink must be paired with their amazing pastries such as, their house made Kobocha Molasses Loaf, Clotted Cream Kouign-Amann, Custom Toast Fillings, or their light, refreshing, and fruity chia seed bowls!  There's so much more I can say about this establishment. But as mentioned in the beginning, this place is ""Breathtaking.""",4,11/28/2018,3,0,1,40.7603019,-73.9907769

Black Press Coffee,4.5,"Great place!  Hubby and I was doing an intense amount of walking on our last visit and, with the time zone changes, the red eye flight, and being overall butt-tired, I needed caffeine.  Badly.  Looked at the Yelp app, found this place, and we were (thankfully!) just around the block and could pop in.  We walked in, was immediately greeted with a ""Welcome"" and a smile, and was able to order our drinks after asking a few drinks.  Despite being super-tired, we didn't want to get too caffeinated, so we opted for iced tea instead.  What I like is that they actually brew the tea for a few minutes, and then place it over the ice.  Correctly done!  So, we paid for our order, was asked if we wanted a stamp card (which we declined since we don't live in the area, and unsure on when our next visit would be), and then waited a few minutes until our order was called.  Drinks were great!  No issues with our orders, it was prepared exactly as requested, and it tasted good.    Employee was awesome!  Very nice, very helpful and accommodating, and was overall a cool guy.    It's a cute cafe and while there are barstools looking out the window, it's still a small street, so there isn't too much people-watching going on.  Place was relatively clean, and there is a bathroom available (we quickly found out that not all cafes have bathrooms...).  There aren't too many tables, though, and plenty of customers that are studying or working and won't be budging.

Black Press Coffee,4.5,"I've been to Black Press a few times now. It is a nice, clean, chic space with friendly staff. I got wind of them as I saw their macchiato in the waffle cone posted on Instagram. It piqued my interest so I headed down one lunch break to try it. Unfortunately they were out of said waffle cones at the time (too popular for their own good). Instead I tried an oat milk latte and was really happy with it.  After a few weeks I reached out to them on Instagram and asked if they'd gotten the waffle cones back in stock. They were very responsive and told me exactly when they had them. I stopped by the next Saturday when I was in the area. I tried the waffle cone macchiato with oat milk and it was delicious. Oak milk is more savory than almond milk so it balanced well with the chocolate dipped cone. I enjoyed it immensely. Probably best that the drink is on the smaller side or I would have found myself in a chocolate food coma.  Bonus points - they don't charge extra for the waffle cone, the bathroom and cafe are very clean. I'll be back :-)",4,4/27/2018,3,0,3,40.7422415,-73.9831177

Croissant wasn't flaky, layered and airy as a croissant should be but rather chewy and dense.

I decided to upgrade to the black version - adding activated charcoal which is meant to do all sorts of magical things including whiten your teeth, soothe your stomach, detoxify your whatever from whatever stuff you did over the last couple of days - and I have to say I like it. The cortado is still there, laying slightly under the taste of the charcoal but pleasantly so.

Except in the mornings it's usually crowded with people in suits and business dresses.  The menu is pretty simple to navigate with cold brew being their top iced coffee choice. I ordered that and asked them to put milk and simple syrup. The milk and simple syrup were both self serve. I found it kind of strange that they had their simple syrup bottle in a plastic unlabeled squirt bottle since I wasn't sure if that's what they were referring to. It was a little watered down and I was confused if it was even sweetening my drink.  The service in the morning was a little slower than I normally expected but that's definitely expected since it was early on Monday morning.

Culture 36,4,"Came here after work on a Thursday to catch up with a friend. Got there at 5:30 and there were only two chocolate chip cookies and three cranberry somethings left on the rack. Got the chocolate chip ($3)-it tasted homemade but I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I would as if it were fresh out of the oven.  This place takes card, service was nice and there r three two seater tables against the wall which r good for chats. The music wasn't too loud, but you did need to raise your voice a little to hear yourself. However, I preferred this volume so that other people cant really hear my conversations lol. Great vibes and good proximity to herald square!",4,7/12/2018,0,0,1,40.7531989,-73.9912442
Culture 36,4,"It's not very hard to miss the store since the interior itself stands out from the juxtaposed stores and you can see the inside through the glass window. Interior itself is quite minimalistic, with limited seating and a short, simple menu as well. The music is pretty loud here so probably not the best place for people to do work if it's distracting or to catch up with someone. Definitely recommend if you're trying to grab and go though.  Coffee is pretty average. I had an iced americano and there wasn't anything special about it to me, but it was smooth and didn't have that sour taste that a lot of other coffees in the area tend to have. The cookie is definitely the selling point for this cafe though! It goes for $3 a pop and it's definitely worth! They're nice and crispy on the outside, but have the right amount of softness and chewiness inside. The cookie isn't too thick so it's not overwhelming and they're about the size of your palm (maybe a little bigger). This is definitely one of the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever bought ^_^",4,6/27/2018,1,1,1,40.7531989,-73.9912442
Culture 36,4,Delicious espresso drinks !! Love the oat milk latte. So creamy and smooth. Latte with special/ non dairy milk clocked in at $5 (50cents extra). Pretty standard or slightly cheaper than other places who charge more for non dairy milk. The rest of the menu is your typical espresso drink menu.  Store itself is average size- there are a few seats (maybe 10-12 or so total including the window seats?). Chill hipster vibe and clean design. The cookies look amazing! I think I saw vegan ones before but not this time. They also have a few other sweet pastries to go with your coffee!  Overall a solid choice for coffee in the midtown area. Nice to sit for a bit and chat with a friend or read a book.,4,4/27/2018,3,1,2,40.7531989,-73.9912442

It's a large space but without too much seating (2- two tops, a few seats by the window, and a larger shared table in the center) which makes you feel like there's room to breathe.  I enjoyed an almond milk latte, while my friends got flat whites-- all were quite good. Interestingly, they don't have soy milk- only almond and oat (the latter is new to me). Based on the other recommendations, I also grabbed a chocolate chip cookie for my brother, and it certainly got his stamp of approval!

Culture 36,4,"I was really pleasantly surprised by my experience at Culture 36! I was a little worried about the upscale, ""Brooklyn hipster"" vibes at first - with the ambiance, the chill staff, and the music, it almost felt ""too cool."" But I quickly became impressed with the friendly staff and quality customer service. There is a good amount of seating for a cafe around this area, and although it's conveniently by the chaos of Herald Square, it feels separate from all of the noise. There is also free wifi! The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the food selection was mostly pastries and sweets, as opposed to maybe a more well-rounded menu, but the food was also decently priced! All around $3-$4 dollars. I'm not sure if it would be the best place to work (it definitely had that loud cafe buzz of people chatting when I visited on a Thursday morning), but in general, I would definitely come again!",4,7/5/2018,0,0,0,40.7531989,-73.9912442

Felix Roasting Co,4.5,"Unique decor for this cute cafe in midtown east serving up craft coffee. You can tell a lot of people are here for the pictures / instagram haha. It's not your typical modern looking cafe-- the decor is more eclectic/ vintage and definitely feels cozy. The coffee bar is right in the middle so the seats surround the coffee bar.  They have some specialty coffee drinks like their s'mores latte which is very pricey (did not try this). I tried a flat white and it was delicious! Great espresso and they use housemade almond milk which is very thick and creamy. It was ~$5-6 which is pretty standard for an espresso drink in ny.  They make a lot of things in house such as their own syrups, mocha, etc.  I love that they have various milks on tap! So if you got a drip coffee or cold brew you can help yourself to their milk selection- including their housemade almond milk!!  Overall, a cool cafe experience here. If you are just about the coffee itself though you can probably get similar standard espresso drink at most craft coffee places. Unless you want to try their specials of course !",4,1/31/2019,4,2,5,40.7449729,-73.9831812

It's yet another addition to the list of places that'll be flooded with instagrammers trying to get more likes. But for now, it's quite a warm welcoming place , kind of quite with first come first serve seatings, gorgeous decor and beautiful looking drinks. Yes the pieces of their signatures coffees are a bit on the higher end but if you are here , you aren't here just for a regular coffee.

Felix Roasting Co,4.5,"I found this place on Yelp's Hot and New Cafes! Oh buddy, am I glad that I stumbled into this gem.  Felix Roasting Co is the definition of a high end and sophisticated coffee shop. The interior design felt like I was ordering coffee in a royal palace. There are plenty of seatings, but there are also a lot of people. I came here during the afternoon and the place was filled with people working, reading and socializing. There might be a wait to get a table after you order your coffee (it's worth the wait).  I ordered the Hickory Smoked S'mores Latte. At first I was a bit hesitant as I never paid $18 for a small glass of Latte, but..... it was worth a one time experience. The barista will make this drink in front of you, very IG worthy. The taste of the latte definitely made it feel like I was waking up in the forest with the natural smell of forest wood. I slowly sipped on the latte while eating the marshmallow on a real branch. This was by far one of the more creative coffee drinks I have consumed.  I would come back to Felix again to try their other coffee, but the price for the Hickory might be too steep for me.

Felix Roasting Co,4.5,So have your expectations set correctly when you come to this place. You're not coming here for your regular coffee. This is a first date place or an indulgence when you want to spoil yourself or something of an instagram experience!

My coffees were spot on in flavor and flawless in presentation. Although I prefer my latte a tad warmer I can't complain as it's a personal preference and no reflection on the barista. I did make the request for a warmer coffee on my second round and I was graciously accommodated.  Worth the effort to visit.

Felix Roasting Co,4.5,"As other reviewers commented, this place is definitely an Instagrammers dream. The second you step inside here, there is bright funky colored wallpaper lining the walls with wood paneling, colored upholstered seating, tables and chairs with beautiful flower displays on each and high ceilings. I definitely took some cool pictures but this was in no way a cozy coffee shop, I felt like I was in the lobby of a fancy hotel. The floors were patterned green and pink and the place to order your food and coffee felt like the hotel lobby desk. It was in the center of the space with tables all around the outside. I could totally see why people would fall in love with this place, it was definitely different than any other coffee shop I've entered in NYC but for me, it lacked that cozy coffee shop feel. What was a little shocking for me was the price of an 8 ounce coffee. Almost $4 for a small cup, which is definitely pricier than what you are paying at other high end coffee shops for their 12 ounce size. The coffee, again, came in a very instagram worthy cup, funky patterned coloring with the words Felix Roasting Company in gold lettering. When I asked if they had almond milk, they said they had their homemade version and the woman was able to tell me what was in it because it's made with pepita seeds and she wants to make sure I knew there what was in there for allergy purposes. I opted out of their homemade almond creamer as in the past with homemade almond milk I haven't been a big fan of it. I took a seat at a fancy table and had a few sips of my coffee, it was alright but definitely nowhere near one of the best cups I've had in the city. Moral of the story is I wouldn't come back here to cozy up at a table because it's not that kind of place. I wouldn't come back here to spend $4 on a very small cup of coffee because it wasn't memorable. I hope this place does well but it just wasn't for me.",4,10/25/2018,6,0,3,40.7449729,-73.9831812

I've never been to another one of their locations to compare but, for this area on 10th Ave, the space is amazing. I ordered the soup of the day, which was Creamy Zucchini, Spinach, and Scallion, and the Chevre Salad. The soup was served in a fairly large sized bowl with 3 slices of bread. The flavors and texture were pleasing and overall it was a nice accompaniment to the salad. Their Chevre salad was served in a large bowl and had an insane amount of goat cheese which I was able to spread on some of the bread that was served with my soup. The beets and candied walnuts were delicious and the honey lemon vinaigrette was the right balance of sweet and tart. This was the best salad I've had in a long time. I will definitely be back to try their sandwiches and other treats. The coffee was excellent as well, and you can enjoy free refills if you are staying. Service was friendly and attentive.

For Five Coffee Roasters,4.5,"I got the matcha latte with macadamia milk - unfortunately the milk itself doesn't taste very strongly of macadamia (whereas almond milk is very strongly almond-y), and the matcha is lacking in concentration (i.e. too much milk which causes the drink to just taste like flavored milk).  The staff here were not very friendly or helpful, no one talks to you aside from taking your order - it gives off a very cold feeling (when you're used to coffee shop baristas having an open and welcoming feel / persona).  If you take a look at the menu, it's very confusing because a latte is 4.25/4.75 (which is made with espresso) whereas a matcha latte is 4.75+0.50 = 5.25 (which doesn't have espresso but does have matcha). It's a very odd way of pricing - I would have felt better with a more transparent menu that states a matcha latte is 5.25 rather than their weird ""matcha shot"" +0.50 line item.  Either way, I'm sticking with other matcha options in the cafes less than one block away or just making my own from now on.",4,6/14/2017,5,2,4,40.7578419,-73.98318389

The best part was that we helped the workers look for an item someone had left behind at the spot where we were seated and they gave us a free pastry to say sorry for interrupting us, so nice, and so delicious!

This gem is everything that could make your mornings more cheerful than your average, depressing wait in Starbucks. I also used to go to Simon Sipps in my office building until I found a place with a more creative menu. Cue For Five Coffee Roasters!  The drinks are well-executed with the utmost attention by the baristas. You could really tell that the team work together instead of doing things in a mundane assembly line fashion. My favorite drink is the Dona Chai latte on the menu. It has a nice, spicy tang to every taste. Not too sour and not too spicy. Note that you can also purchase the chai concentrate from Whole Foods (closest is the Bryant Park location) - which retails at a cheaper price. Otherwise, I also get the cappuccino with soy milk - topped with a velvety layer of foam.  The decor is bright, open, and fun. The waiting area creates enough space for you to walk around and stare at the high ceilings. The last thing on my mind is to take a break and go to a coffee shop that's cramped with angry corporate people. For Five Coffee Roasters make sure that this is the perfect cubicle getaway for you.

However there are times you want something a bit less crazed and more sophisticated feeling.  On a recent weekend trip into the city, For Five Coffee Roasters was the place I went to for this experience.  Set inside a larger, modern looking building, this space is very bright and elegant looking.  The large glass in front lets light pour in and the seating is very comfortable with a series of tables and seats set up in a small area towards the back where you will even find some power plugs to charge up your phone.  The staff was very nice when I asked them questions.  I bought a coffee (served in a mug when you eat in) and a yogurt with fruit.  The yogurt was great, but there were too many sweet elements in it (such as raisins and other dried fruit) for my taste.  I would have liked more yogurt and less of the fruit, but that may just be my personal taste.  The coffee was very good and full of flavor.  In addition to pastries, coffee and tea, For Five also sells coffee beans, chai mixes and other food items to bring the experience of the place home.

The most important part is that the espresso is good. Real good.  Sure, it's fun to see a latte made using spouts coming out of the countertop, but the latte had better kill it - and it did. Baristas are clearly proficient.  There's adequate seating and a nice vibe. Whole beans for sale, with many blends to choose from, alongside barista favorites like the Acaia scale & Bodum French press.  There's a pretty solid food menu that I'll have to return for.

Food is good, prices are a tad high but worth it, and who doesn't love a good pun when naming a place?",4,1/27/2019,0,0,0,40.7637495,-73.9846917
Ground Central,4.5,"Delicious coffee in a hip little space. My husband & I went here to grab some real coffee after searching reviews on Yelp. After reading reviews, I opted for a Dirty Chai Latte and he got a Caramel Latte. They have a lot of options for milk, or milk replacements, which is great if you dont want regular. Overall, definitely a great spot to check out, whether you want to grab a coffee to go or sit and study/chill.",4,1/20/2019,0,0,0,40.7637495,-73.9846917

Ground Central,4.5,"I. Am. Obsessed.  We were on our way to Central Park and needed a caffeine boost. I whipped out my phone to Yelp some great local coffee shops, but nothing was suiting my fancy. And then, we stumbled upon this gem. I knew as I walked in that I was going to love the place. The music was bumping and the baristas were sassy and wonderful. The walls were painted black with amazing sketches all over them. You could tell there were regulars stopping in to grab their morning joe because the baristas knew them by name. This. This is what a local coffee shop is all about.  I ordered a latte and my better half ordered a chai tea latte. They were beautiful.  Thank you Ground Central for being awesome.

Ground Central,4.5,"I'm always on the hunt for #aesthetic spots near Times Square, so I checked out Ground Central around noon today. It's heavy on the black-and-white hand-drawn walls and packed with people tapping away on laptops, but it manages to feel peaceful. There are tons of books in the back nook. The music was old-school and tasteful. They use the darkness of the space to look cozy.  They have a big menu of espresso drinks, cold brew, nitros, and teas. I went for an espresso ($3.50). It came out within a couple minutes. A little bit bitter, but nothing that the well-kept sugar and spice shelf couldn't fix.  I asked for an espresso to go, but I can forgive them for accidentally giving it to me to stay. The plating was cute and the (ginger?) cookie was yummy. Nice to sit for a moment.

So I tried one of their donuts and got my cappuccino on the house. Staff was friendly, greeted me, explained the offer, and helped me pick out a pastry. The donut was really good, it was kind of heavy and I only ended up eating less than half but that just means more for later. Cappuccino was really good - strong! They even put a little heart in the milk froth which is a cute touch. Prices weren't bad for a New York coffee shop. The place was a little slow when I went in which was nice you could order your coffee without feeling rushed.

I had a delicious oat milk latte- i know it may sound strange and weird but it really is amazing. Super creamy (just like whole milk), with a nice strong espresso.  This store is pretty big. Baristas were friendly. Warning-- the chai powder has dairy! I asked just to make sure. So if you are vegan or dairy-free, you can't have the chai lattes here ): Conveniently located near columbus circle, I will return again for sure!",4,10/17/2017,5,1,3,40.7637495,-73.9846917

The temperature was really warm and cozy so I never had to wear my coat inside, even though I was sitting near the door. The Wi-Fi was a bit spotty so I ended up connecting via my phone instead, but still lovely.  DRINKS/FOOD I got a sugarless matcha latte with almond milk, and it tasted exactly like it should. If you're someone who knows a lot about matcha and expects it as is (and not super sweet), this place makes it really legit. Highly recommend.

Ground Central,4.5,This ground central recently opened on 8th Ave and its got a great address. Unfortunately I don't feel the same  about its coffee. I decided to give this place a shot even though I have been to the east side location several times and didn't like it.  I tried the Nitro here and it definitely wasn't what I expected. The Nitro erred on the sour side and wasn't very smooth or creamy-like.  The service was good though. The cashier let us know of their current promotion and was very patient as my friend and I were deciding on drinks.  Not sure I'm ready to make a second visit yet but I'm sure I'll try to keep an open mind and throw it in my mix.,4,9/27/2017,2,0,3,40.7637495,-73.9846917

Expect a simple menu of coffee shop essentials such as drinks and pastries. The brevity of options means the staff know their craft well, and they present drinks that are attractive and well crafted. Rather than a dessert drink, the mocha is low in sugar and high on espresso, giving a stable charge of energy that lasts. The pastry selection was limited to three varieties on my visit, but all well crafted and nicely textured.

The matcha latte is legit and well prepared. If you want it unsweetened, you get that as well. It's right next to Nordstrom rack.

To my surprise, it almost feels like they read my first review, because the things I had complained about were fixed! They are using ""original"" almond milk now for their matcha latte instead of the ""unsweetened,"" so it doesn't taste overly salty anymore. Also, they've figured out how not to make their matcha scone overly salty too-- If I had to guess, their previous recipe contained too much baking soda, resulting in an overly salty aftertaste. I dare say their matcha scone is perfectly balanced now.  Anyways, I know its highly unlikely that they actually made changes based on my little yelp review, but major props to them if they did.

First off, this is the first place I've ever seen fresh squeezed grapefruit juice on its menu. I had to get it! Love grapefruit juice, love fresh squeezed juice, so this was doubly satisfying.  Second, their Rabbit Hole brunch item is so popular, they ran out by 1pm on a Saturday.  As for what we did order: Maman's breakfast sandwich - B+ (definitely expect it to be on the sweeter side) Waffle iron hashbrowns - A (hearty, nicely seasoned)",4,4/24/2019,0,0,1,40.7432672,-73.9901338

I took one star off because they have an open kitchen and the entire restaurant smelled like burnt toast.  Maman's 'rabbit hole' (3.5/5) - we got this because of its name, probably should have gone with the popular Maman's breakfast sandwich instead (that'll be my pick next time) Croque maman (5/5) - WOW, this was so so good!

Actually feels more like you're at a cool cafe in a small city than in NYC - they're much too friendly and homey to be hardened Apple denizens!  Beautiful coffee art made with love. Very tasty latte with a lovely flower.  Food quite good.  Greek yogurt parfait was delicious with full fat yogurt, great berries, and good granola.  Smashed avocado toast was good; I added a fried egg. I wish the toast had been hot when I got it; lukewarm is not how I prefer avocado toast, but it was still good. Avocado tartine is actually made with egg salad, avocado and watermelon radishes. It looked pretty, but I don't like egg salad in the am.  You order at the counter and then sit down.  Definitely homey, no attitude, and they're super friendly. Much more fun than going to an overpriced, pretentious brunch place in the neighborhood to have ordinary omelettes at a more expensive price. But it was not my fave avocado toast of all time.",4,1/2/2019,1,1,1,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4,"This is an adorable and cozy little cafe in the middle of nomad.  I came here after a run class next door to meet a friend for coffee and breakfast and it was a great little spot.  The kitchen doesn't open until 8am but I think the store in general is open much earlier.  They have plenty of seating in the middle, with free water and WiFi. The front is only for coffee drinks and some pastry, the cold brew was really great.  The back has many good breakfast options from quiche to salads and tartines, the girl in the back was super friendly and made my tartine into a salad allowing me to pretend to keep keto- the salad was amazingly fresh!  The cushion and seating area was a bit untidy but overall it's a really cute cafe!",4,12/5/2018,2,0,1,40.7432672,-73.9901338

I had the Maman's Breakfast Sandwich which has (a very thin) layer of avocado on seeded bread, a sunny side up egg, roasted tomatoes, and jam flavored bacon. It was actually much more delicious than I'd expected for a cafe sandwich. The White Chocolate Matcha Croissant is just meh even tho I'm always biased when it comes to matcha. They serve Toby's Estate coffee here - solid.  The place does get crowded and very noisy during morning coffee and lunch hour but other than that it's bearable.

Maman Nomad,4,"~ review is for bakery ~  // Nutella Beignet The Nutella Beignet is one of the most decadent doughnuts you'll ever eat. The sugar dusted beignet has a dough texture that is extremely fluffy. I'm talking pillow fluffy. You'll also notice the color of the exterior is a beautiful golden brown. It's topped with a dollop of Nutella and little beads of chocolate. But the best part? It's filled with gobs of Nutella. As soon as you take a bite you'll get hit with a Nutella Bomb.  // Choc Chip Cookie The chocolate chip cookie here is another must-have bakery item. It seems like this is one of the lesser mentioned chocolate chip cookies in the competitive NYC chocolate chip cookie scene. But I think it's one of the most underrated and should be up there with the best chocolate chip cookies.  It's just crisp enough on the outside with a soft interior and a mix of solid and melting chocolate chips. The color and composition of the cookie dough varies throughout, and the shape isn't a perfect circle. This makes for a much more interesting cookie. I think completely uniformity in dough is boring. What elevates it even more is the crunch and nuttiness from macadamia nuts, walnuts, and almonds. The finishing touch is coarse sea salt, which enhances the chocolate flavor and adds subtle bite. This cookie goes beyond your typical chocolate chip cookie with its dynamic range of texture, sweetness, and richness.",4,8/20/2018,1,1,1,40.7432672,-73.9901338

On a Sunday morning, the restaurant was pretty crowded and we were told the wait would be 30-40 minutes for our party of 2. We waited no longer than 15 minutes and were seated. While we waited for our seats we ordered coffees by the entrance. Definitely recommend the Mocha latte.  For brunch, I had the Maman Breakfast sandwich which hit the spot. The flavor was on point and the portion size was perfect.  I had no complaints about the experience and look forward to coming back again soon!

Maman Nomad,4,"The eggs ratatouille was incredible !! I've never been a big fan of tomatoes, but after having this dish it's been all I've been craving ! The eggs tasted amazing baked on top with crumbled feta and pretty floral garnishes. My friend got the avocado toast and also liked that. We both got matcha lattes (mine iced and hers hot) and we were impressed with how good they are and not overpriced like many spots in the area.  I met my friend here for brunch on a Sunday around 11 and was really pleased the restaurant was not overcrowded and there were a few tables empty. The inside is filled with plants and floral wallpaper that offered a relaxing morning atmosphere despite being just off Madison square park.

I'm a big fan of all the flowers and setup.  The coffee was great. However I wasn't the biggest fan of the avocado toast. I wanted poached eggs and they said they couldn't do that. After seeing it , it makes sense that it wouldn't go with the other flavors. All in all it was an extra take on a classic.  If you're in the area go; it's adorable.

Maman Nomad,4,Everything was basically sold out at 3:30pm so come early! I ordered the white chocolate pretzel cookie (3.5/5) since their classic chocolate chip cookie was sold out. It was really sweet and indulgent. There wasn't really a pretzel/salty flavor as one would expect besides the pretzel on top of the cookie. I feel like they could do with some pretzel pieces throughout the cookie to really have that sweet and salty contrast flavor. Texture-wise was perfect - soft semi doughy/fudgy cookie with crisp and caramelized edges. Would have been even better if they could warm it up!  The service at the counter was subpar. The baristas who took the orders were not friendly and not helpful at all.,4,7/25/2018,0,0,0,40.7432672,-73.9901338

Maman Nomad,4,"This was such a cute little surprise to find! I was planning on going to another coffee shop around the corner, but after that one was too crowded, I stumbled across Maman. And what a change in ambience! Rather than the chaotic hustle and bustle from the streets outside, Maman provided a quiet, relaxing atmosphere. The best word I think I can use is ""soothing."" The walls are decorated beautifully, the chairs and tables provide a very modern, clean feel, and the lighting is bright and natural. The pastries looked delicious and homemade, and they also had a full food menu. Our barista was also really friendly, making small talk with us and sharing her knowledge about the drinks. I would definitely give Maman 5 stars for atmosphere, ambiance, and customer service.  My only downside was the taste/quality of the beverage I ordered. I ordered an iced matcha latte (for $5.50), and it tasted watery, with only a small amount of matcha. Maybe it's because it was an iced beverage, so it became watered down, but I wouldn't order it again. I'd say 3 stars for taste.

Well, 20 min later, we were standing there with no coffee.  The barista in the front made my drink when I asked where it was, but it was a waste of time.

Maman Nomad,4,I unfortunately did not have the best visit yesterday at Maman. My friend and I both ordered the eggs ratatouille. Given it is a dish that is cooked in a cast iron pan it would take a little bit of time to come out of the kitchen. I had ordered a drip coffee that came immediately and I asked for it with some almond milk (2oz if that) on the side which later I found out they charged me $.50 for which was absolutely ridiculous for the amount given. And I didn't even use more than a drop. I don't understand places that do this. If I had asked for cream or regular milk there would be no additional charge. And I completely understand paying extra for non dairy milk in a latte or a drink that has a cup or more of milk but for a drop on the side of my coffee 50 cents is outrageous.  After waiting about 20 min for our food our waitress came over and asked if we were ready for the check... umm no we haven't gotten our food yet. We were both shocked. Did she forget we ordered? Did she not even put our order in? There was no apology for the mistake and instead she flaunted it off that the dish takes time to make. We waited again for awhile then finally received our food. Thankfully it was delicious but the overall experience was not good. I'm bummed about my experience and hope if I decide to come back it will be better.,4,9/24/2018,1,0,0,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4,"I was able to stop into the Maman location in Flatiron to grab coffee and catch up with a friend on a Thursday evening. After being to their location in Williamsburg, I only had high hopes for this location in the city. After my experience here I'm happy to report that those hopes were met! From the service to the ambiance, everything made for a great experience!  My friend and I arrived on a Thursday evening around 5:45 PM. When we walked in their were only about 3 other people at the cafe, which surprised me. Maybe this location isn't as packed after work? Maybe people don't know about it as much as their other locations? Regardless, if that's the case, then this is definitely a spot to go to if you're looking to grab coffee with a friend, read a book, or just have some time to yourself.  We both ended up ordering matcha latte's ($5.45). Really great quality and served in a nice mug. Definitely makes for an added plus while you're sitting and enjoying your beverage.  Staff was super nice and extremely considerate. We were their near the time they were closing and they informed us when they were about to clean the space, and when we had a few minutes left before they officially closed.

Maman Nomad,4,"I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning.  I've been to the Maman on Centre St so I was excited to try out this newer location.  There was a line out the door.  There wasn't a hostess so the table service was very slow and disorganized.  I found out later that the girl who was doing take out service was actually supposed to sit guests for table service as well.  We waited about 20 minutes for a table for 2 people.  It took a while for a waitress to come to our table for everything: water, ordering, serving food, and getting the check.  We ordered the lavender banana waffles and the rabbit hole (cornmeal bun stuffed with panchetta, squash, egg, arugula).  By the time we received the entrees, the food was cold.  I did enjoy the rabbit hole brunch entree since it was flavorful and the ingredients were fresh.  I do wish it was warmer.  The waffles were dry since it was made of cornmeal and I didn't taste the lavender.  When I went to the bathroom and walked back to the table, 3 waitresses were blocking the aisle arguing about which tables ordered what.   Clearly, the staff were not well trained so service was a total mess.  I will never come back, will just stick with going to the Centre St location.",4,11/4/2018,3,0,1,40.7432672,-73.9901338

Maman Nomad,4,"I stepped outside Mile High Run Club after throwing down almost 4 miles, craving caffeine and carbs, and started searching my Yelp app for help. Then I paused, looked up from my phone and realized I was standing right next to this cute little spot. It's not often I don't do my research before going somewhere to grab a bite or drink when I'm traveling, but Maman just looked so warm and inviting I made an exception to the rule.  Cold brew was on point, and I bought a Nutella Beignet and a Pistachio Chocolate Croissant for me and my husband to split. The Nutella beignet was as good as everyone says. The pistachio chocolate croissant... I love pain au chocolat and I love pistachio, but I have also lived in Paris and eaten at Lune Croissanterie in Melbourne, so I have been spoiled/ruined forever for pastry in some regards. I try to keep in mind that lamination of that caliber literally takes days and ain't nobody got time for that. The croissant was certainly above average - I'd probably call it a love child between a paris brest and a croissant in regards to how much pistachio cream was generously stuffed in there. Sorta how new york bagelries will spread cream cheese to excess on your bagel unless instructed otherwise.  Anywho, it was all good enough to be almost erring on the side of five stars except for the barista who seems super annoyed by my to go order of two pastries and a cold brew... because she was busy making a ton of coffee orders for the server who seemed annoyed with her. So I didn't take it personally, but it certainly impacted my experience. But if you're a New Yorker, you probably don't care if the service isn't the best as long as the food is good. Which it is, so... no wonder it's so popular. I'd stick with to go orders from here though.",4,9/1/2018,2,1,1,40.7432672,-73.9901338

Firstly, lots of room to sit. Secondly, all my fave bevs (really into their teas right now) Thirdly, still all the old French charm. Fourthly, mobbed completely in the middle of the day but you can definitely get a table if you head in early. Fifthly, go ahead and have some quiche. I won't tell.

Paper Coffee,4.5,"I am conflicted on the ultimate star rating. The skinny rating - 4 to 5 stars for quality of coffee and service -but 2 to 3 star for pricing  This little coffee space is a relatively new find [compared to various coffee shops that I frequent throughout NYC]. Their drips have been consistently good and their nitro [only cold brew option at the moment] are decent as well.  In terms of price, I would classify this as a relatively expensive coffee place, which does not surprise me since it's located inside a hotel and ergo, probably charges a premium for this reason.  While I would love to make this a daily/weekly stop, I must say this is a splurge if i have to spend over $5 for a cup of coffee. For some context, $5.50 for a nitro that's only 8oz is a hefty premium. The price should reflect what is being paid for. The nitros that I have had are already cold so it doesn't make sense to pay for a cup of ice. From a customer's perspective, if I pay $5.50+ tax, and see a small cup in front of me, it is rather dissatisfying.  As another example, paying $6-7 market price for pour overs where most places charge $4-5. With pour overs, quality is variable so l will just leave it at that.  I now must think twice before making this visit because : 1. The price 2. I would rather not be that customer causing a scene  To mgmt - I was trying to write this in an email but didn't see an email for this shop and didn't want it to get lost in the hotel reviews.",4,4/24/2019,0,0,0,40.74632816,-73.98963081

Little sofas and cushioned seats are cozy and I would be able to spend hours here with friends. It's very generous of the hotel to let outside guests hang out.  To-stay cups were beautiful.

Paper Coffee,4.5,"Paper Coffee is the coffee shop located in the very cool Made Hotel just north of the Flatiron District. It's pretty large and its wooden design and large windows invite customers to stay for awhile to work at one of the several tables.  They sell morning baked goods and really good coffee. The baristas know what they are doing and my latte was one of the best I've had in NYC (and that's saying a lot for a city with great coffee shops).

Paper Coffee,4.5,"As everyone mentioned, Paper Coffee is located at the front entrance of the MADE hotel. It's very wooden so there's immediately a warm and cozy feel to the place. They server some of their coffee beverages in beautiful and simple clay cups, which I personally really love.  The space where the counter is located is actually quite small, making it very difficult to walk by people without bumping into them. Being able to carry your drink into the lobby and work there is a huge plus, which is why I gave this place 4 stars. Unless you get a good seat inside the lobby, you can't really get comfortable in the actual cafe area and the layout is not optimal to do ""real"" work. Best for light, friendly conversations and to enjoy coffee. If I had to get real work done, I'd prefer the ACE hotel lobby a couple streets away.",4,1/13/2019,3,1,1,40.74632816,-73.98963081

The baristas are knowledgeable, sweet, and ready to answer any questions you might have. Even when it's busy, you'll never have a problem finding a cozy nook where you can set up your stuff and study.

Paper Coffee,4.5,"Paper coffee inside the Made hotel was a spacious yet an intimate place to grab a coffee. The interior were sleek, warm and welcoming. We grabbed an Americano followed by a latte. I really enjoyed the Americano more. I found the milk a little heavy handed in the latte and over threw the coffee, making it weak. I also grabbed a bar snack. A Caprese sandwich. I was surprised to see 2 pieces of white bread encase the mozzarella, tomato and fresh basil. I guess that's why they call it a sandwich Doh!!! In someway I expected it to be toasted. Totally my fault on that. The 2 pieces of bread made it a little boring especially as the mozzarella wasn't across the whole sandwich, so at one point I was eating bread, tomato and basil. It was a bit sad not to get all the flavours together.  Service was solid and really attentive. I loved the China wear. Great mugs and milk jug. It was really nice to receive it this way without asking. Drinking coffee from China really intensifies the flavour.

PROOF Coffee Roasters,4.5,"Proof makes their own coffee and sells it in premade packs. I've had an double espresso, americano and flat white on various occasions which were solid in flavor and quantity. It is on the more bitter, smoky side but not burnt like Starbucks. They also have some breakfast and lunch items available - oatmeal, sandwiches, pastries, etc - and an oven for warming or roasting.  Its located between 27 and 26 streets (2nd & 1st Avenues) inside a residential complex and across the street from a park. Theres lots of seating options including a bench with coffee bag pillows. It's never super busy either and they do have wi-fi for those who want to monopolize their study/work time over coffee. Nearby hospital row on 1st & 2nd Avenues so you'll see people coming in their scrubs.  Overall it's a nice coffee shop nestled in a quiet area with not a lot of tourists and reasonable prices.

PROOF Coffee Roasters,4.5,"Quite possibly the best espresso I've ever had. Super delicious and the staff here is exceptional. They take customer service to a whole new level and it's refreshing because you really don't see that everywhere. The cafe is right in the middle of a park area so you have to go out of your way to find it. Right near Bellevue Hospital and NYU it's definitely a spot frequented by employees at both institutions. It's pretty nice because you can sit on the benches right outside the cafe or inside. Seating is a bit limited in here, it's small. They have a few tables, some seating in the window, high top bar seating along the wall, facing the wall and a little couch/chair type thing. The place is decorated so nicely, it's really relaxing in there, lots of greenery and cool decor to look at. Kind of a bear mountain theme.  Anyways, their coffee is great, they have specialty drinks that sound delicious like iced nutella drinks and other yummy things. They have some food, cafe type food, some KIND bars, etc. They have non-dairy creamers too. To be honest, the place is expensive. For example a large decaf americano is $4.20. Steep you know? Worth it because it's delicious, but steep. Last time I came in, one of the baristas came around with water glasses for everyone in the place as it was a really warm day outside. Like I said, exceptional service. NYU employees receive 10% off, which is a nice incentive. The atmosphere in here will keep me coming back.

It's about the same price of a SB latte, I honestly don't mind paying extra for coffee for the quality of the coffee, I think it's completely worth it (spoken from a true coffee lover who is alive after the first sip of coffee).

PROOF Coffee Roasters,4.5,"At first glance Proof Coffee Roasters looked like a cozy place to order some coffee and study; however, it began to feel stuffy after settling down by the window area and the barista made me feel like an annoyance and bother.  While my girlfriend was ordering a coffee the barista had an annoyed look and began to tap his nails on the register as if other customers were waiting to be served. She was the only person in line... After that experience I felt discouraged about ordering something from the barista because of his annoyed attitude. While my girlfriend ordered the coffee it felt as if milk was scare because she wasn't given the option of different types of milk, but just an attitude of ""do you want milk??"" Then he poured a tiny bit of milk because the cup was 90% full of coffee already.  After that we looked for seats to set up a small workspace.  When we needed Wi-Fi and couldn't find the password written anywhere, my girlfriend went to ask the barista what the password was, and he said, ""I need to type it in,"" which I could find understandable, but his remarks after that left me a little irritated.  ""We don't want people who don't order to just hang around here,"" which came to a shock to me, but I gave him some benefit of the thought.  But the last straw was what he said after that with a smug attitude - ""I hope you get it"", as if stressing the phrase specifically to mean I wasn't allowed to be here. I am shocked that this place has 5 stars on yelp, as we feel like it doesn't deserve more than 1 star for the service.",4,1/27/2018,3,2,1,40.7399117,-73.9774474

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"I think this place was originally just a florist but loved their creativity in making it dual purpose and establishing a cafe within the same space. The air quality in here is super crisp and refreshing thanks to all the lush, happy, healthy plants filling the shop (seriously, the difference is instantaneous one you get out of the dirty city air outside).  Since the space is only small (10-12 people), you won't be getting a large group in here, nor is it child friendly (too many things for them to touch and break). It is a great space to work away on your laptop though which is what half the people in here were doing. There is a restroom too, very beautifully decorated with plants (I kinda just wanted to stay in there, it was so nice...minus the florist materials they also stored in there haha xD).  There isn't a great deal of food or snack items but they do have some lovely Madeleine cookie cake thingies as well as some delicious mini friands (I bought a bag of matcha ones, just trust me and do it, you can thank me later!). There was a decent variety in drinks both hot and cold at average cost of $5-6 dollars. I ordered the iced matcha latte (with skim milk) and my husband got an iced lavender latte. My matcha latte was very generic but my husband's lavender latte (with skim milk) was quite nice, they actually used dried lavender petals and the coffee beans used taste superior to the general population of coffee houses. I saw them using glass flasks and spirally tubes to procure the coffee brew, respect to old school methods like that :D .....I think I might've made the barista uncomfortable with the intensity of my fascination, I do that sometimes haha xD  I haven't come across anything like this in NYC, only in Asia, so save yourself the plane ticket and check out this beautiful cafe!!!

Used oatmilk - they have a wide milk selection. Would definitely like to go back - nice place to get some work done or to meet a friend for a coffee date.,4,4/14/2019,0,0,1,40.70544486,-73.99429321
Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"Super cute coffee shop in the middle of a bustling city. The flowers make it seem like you are are taking a break from the fast paced life outside. I ordered the lavender latte, and it was delish. What doesn't give it the perfect rating is that they have limited pastries (including no gluten free options) and limited space. Granted, everywhere in NY has limited space, the flowers took up a lot of space that could have squeezed in at least one other table!",4,3/6/2019,1,0,1,40.70544486,-73.99429321
Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"I've passed this place so many times and I always admire how beautiful it is. At first I thought it was only a flower shop and I didn't realize they sell coffee. I'm so glad I finally paid this place a visit!  The inside is so beautiful. It feels comfortable, calming, relaxing, and inviting. It's really enjoyable to look around at all of the plants while relaxing and enjoying your drink. My only complaint is that it's a small place and I've never found an open seat and been able to really sit inside comfortably.  The drinks match the flower shop theme. There are a lot of floral lattes that are beautifully adorned with flowers on top. I don't like milk and wasn't in a coffee mood so I got one of their tea specials, a grapefruit honey tea. I didn't really enjoy it that much. It really just tasted like warm grapefruit juice. It was $5 plus tax which felt expensive for what I got.  I would come back here again and try another drink. My recommendation would be to get here early to get a spot to actually sit inside and relax.",4,12/3/2018,3,1,1,40.70544486,-73.99429321
Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"What an incredible concept for a coffee and flower shop!  Right when you walk in, you are welcomed by the natural floral aroma and beautiful decor in a small, quaint shop. When it comes to places like this, I was incredibly skeptical that the coffee would not taste as good as the shop looks. However, I can't even complain about that because my lavender and rose lattes were amazing. The floral fragrances were not strong with the coffee; instead, it added a slight freshness every time you took a sip of your coffee. Honestly, I wish that I had discovered this coffee shop a lot earlier into my trip so that I could have stopped by here every day.",4,9/30/2018,3,0,0,40.70544486,-73.99429321

I went just for a coffee and decided to try the lavender latte.  It was just amazing. One of the best i have had. They put fresh lavenders on the coffee giving it an amazing flavor and aroma. So much so that when i was sitting with my coffee in the cab, even my driver mentioned ""what's that coffee, it smells amazing!"". No kidding, happened for real.

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"beautiful coffee place in Midtown East!! Visiting friend found this for us to go to while she was here, and the drinks here are so so cute. We got the lavender latte and berry rose milk tea, which were both yummy. I liked the berry rose latte a little more, even though it was essentially rose flavored warm milk. If you like the taste of lavender, the lavender latte is VERY strongly lavender and has more of a coffee aftertaste to it. The flowers in the shop are beautiful, people are really friendly and less touristy, more local neighborhood stop-by-for-our-morning-joe kind of people, and as a plus their drip coffee is only $1 if you check in on yelp.

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,A very cute and cozy coffee shop! A hidden gem in Tudor City. The idea of combining a floral shop and coffee shop is so creative!

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"I'm always surprised when I can grab a seat, considering this coffee shop only has a handful of tables. The popularity of this shop makes sense - the dual use of the space adds to the aesthetics of the coffee shop, and you'll find many people taking photos of their latte art before finally enjoying their drinks. If you're a black coffee drinker, I'd strongly recommend their Americano over drip coffee. Even considering the Yelp check in deal.  Service is hit or miss. The first time I visited, more than half of the people in line literally left without ordering because the line wasn't moving at all. There was only one person at the counter, and she ignored everyone in line while making drinks. While waiting isn't a big deal, a quick acknowledgement or ""we'll take your order asap"" would have been nice. That said, I'm pretty sure this was an anomaly, however, as about 10 minutes later a girl came running in and took her place behind the register.  Wifi: yes, the password can be found at the register Outlets: no Tables: ~3 small tables, one small counter, one communal table",4,10/24/2018,0,0,0,40.70544486,-73.99429321

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"I feel so guilty for not writing a five star review! Remi was a last minute stop to satiate a desperate need for coffee, and it was far from anything less than satisfactory. The shop itself was super humid, but that was just the Manhattan weather at the time. The flowers were beautiful and there were quite a few guests drinking coffee in the shop, but I found that the shop itself was overcrowded and we had to wait behind some flowers to avoid bursting other customers' personal bubbles. I took advantage of the $1 drip coffee offer while my brother got the cortado. The latte art was exquisite, but I felt that I got judged for being in the dark (I was visiting NY for the first time and the policies were definitely not what I was expecting). Other than that, the coffee was satisfactory. I feel that the east coast probably prefers less sweetened coffee than the west overall, because my coffee only came with milk and I didn't see any sugar nearby. However, Remi would still be a ""would recommend"" as a coffee place for me, especially with their $1 coffee deal.",4,9/5/2018,0,1,0,40.70544486,-73.99429321

They have your typical espresso menu and also have drip coffee and cold brew. They have this Kyoto cold brew which is supposed to stronger than regular cold brew. They carry almond, soy and oatly oat milk.  I sat to read for a little over an hour- with ear phones it's pretty good. Without ear phones it's not that quiet. But they play typical coffee house chill music otherwise. It's a little dim for studying I feel.  The decor is more on the edgy hipster side- mostly black and white decor.

From the friendly barista to the cool vibe to the extensive menu (with all your third wave pour over stuff) - everything's great...except the coffee itself. I mostly get espresso based drinks here (cortado, cappuccino) and they always taste bland and lifeless. Whatever beans they use for espresso are pretty one-dimensional and lean toward bitter. I can't taste the sweetness or much acidity in them.  On top of that, I don't know what kind of milk they use (I always ask for regular whole milk) but it just tastes bland. No creamy taste whatsoever.  I'm gonna keep trying other things at this coffee shop to see if they are any better but espresso/milk based drinks are just not up to par.",4,8/29/2018,1,0,1,40.7588772,-73.9902301
St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"10/10 For their coffee & organic teas here! I tried the Earl Grey Organic Tea w/ Oat Milk for the first time and the taste was absolutely amazing and delightful. I also ordered a Whole Wheat Banana Bread slice to try (figured it would be good practice in starting off my healthy lifestyle resolution before the new year) and I am honored to say, it tasted marvelous! I'm quite a big fan of this place.  Reason why I didn't give it a full 5-stars is because each time I come here, the staff makes me feel like I've just upset them with my arrival or perhaps New York in general has jaded them. (I've also only been here 2x in my life, so I'm positive I didn't offend anyone during my visits).  As a solution, I hope all the people who do visit this place greets the staff with a smile and more courtesy. They bring so much joy to the hearts of disgruntled New Yorkers, I think it's worth giving them back the same level of respect and love (at the very least a smile to make them feel better about their days too).",4,12/27/2018,0,0,0,40.7588772,-73.9902301

It definitely has a charming and welcoming atmosphere which is usually a criteria for me when assessing coffeeshops. There are a few tables as the place is quite small, but that is what makes it feel intimate and a great work space since there isn't too much distraction.

All of the coffees smell lovely and have a nice balance - nothing overly acidic or bitter; trust me, this stuff you can drink black even if you don't usually take your coffee that way. Do not ruin this coffee by adding copious amounts of milk or sugar.  The baristas pride themselves on the espresso drinks, and you can tell. I've never had a bad Flat White here; once, my order was taking a while and the barista came over to apologize because the first espresso shot he pulled wasn't good so he had to remake the drink.  I would come here everyday if I could, but unfortunately it is quite expensive, even for NYC standards; a bit of a downer, but I think they raised the prices recently to keep up with rent.

Yes, I should have called in advance to check.  I can't say much about this place as I only ordered a coffee. The cashier was on top of her game informing all arriving customers that there's no longer table service.  They only have espresso drinks and regular drips, no pour overs. Guess I had set my expectations in the wrong place too. That aside, the drop is actually decent. I had the one with a hint of blueberry and to my surprise, there was a hint of it. It's the ""wild"" flavor from Ethiopia.  I didn't make the trek upstairs as there's no table service any way. The first floor has a decent sized space. A little noisy but overall not bad.

My sandwich was delicious and I usually like my order better than his. However I had some breakfast envy when his pancakes were served. He gave me a nibble-melt in your mouth good!

There is a great upstairs space perfect for meetings / working from although my one complaint is have about this cafe is that, for whatever reason, they play their music at a deafeningly loud volume! So much so that all of the people in line for coffee this morning promptly left after receiving their coffee as Gwen Stefani's ""Hollaback Girl"" started blaring though the speaker system... To be clear - I'm not a granny. I'm 21 years old and like getting coffee from a cool,  modern cafe with a sweet Top 40 playlist but this was too much. Nonetheless, come for the coffee and great bites to eat and you won't be disappointed!",4,4/4/2017,3,0,2,40.75147194,-73.9799013
Taylor St Baristas,4,"Small but lively Midtown coffee joint.  Pros: -The space is beautifully decorated. -The background music playlist is hype. -The staff is friendly and welcoming. -Although there is no table seating, there is plenty of bench seating if you're waiting for your order. -The house blends are self-serve, which helps to expedite the queue. -There is a ""try-me"" station where you can sample the house blends before ordering.  Haven't seen other coffee houses doing this before.  HUGE props for this. -They have a wheelchair elevator, which is impressive considering the space is small (it's designed for to-go orders, after all).

I've given it a shot a number of times but most notably, the chia seed pudding is just sugar and water and the banana bread is incredibly disappointing.

The coffees here are delicious; however, there is a reason you only need to buy 4 to get one free, the coffee isn't cheap.  The best aspects of this shop are as follows: - I love that they have sample cups to try their hot coffee - food is healthy and good - chia pudding with mint and apple is light and healthy - cucumber salad with spice and peanuts - I could make this, but it's so nicely prepared - such friendly staff  Their teas and cold brews are also delicious!

It had a delicate taste of coffee but you can still taste the roast, it was honestly so good.

One of the better coffee shops in the area and in NYC which is not an east feat competing with Blue Bottle or Culture. Great loyalty program as others mentioned and super friendly staff with cool accents. Haven't tried the food outside of donuts which are great but look outsourced like the others.  The blends are interesting but would be nice to see a timer on the drips to see how old the brew is and I would like to see more options/more frequent changes of their blends.

I went with wild, as it was labeled as an Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, and Ethiopian coffees are my favorite and it was not a mistake! Their baristas are exceedingly friendly and did not hesitate to introduce me to their unique loyalty card program that gets you one free drink after just four drink purchases.

Taylor St Baristas,4,"I remember reading an article on Sprudge last summer about Taylor St. opening an outpost in NYC near Grand Central. I kept checking back and was excited when they opened a few weeks back. The space is tucked away but once you walk in and see the menu you know it's a legit Aussie style cafe. Sleek, industrial and open, the space is great. You have incredibly friendly people working the counter who know you by name with some tasty food options. The coffee menu is traditional Australian with a proper flat white, piccolos etc...You're encouraged to chat with the baristas at the open espresso bar area. I didn't know what a piccolo was and Coco(head barista) not only explained the difference from a cortado but she actually showed me. Now it's my goto drink every morning. After the holiday weekend one of the baristas showed me photos from an art installation he went to. You become friends with them which makes for a much better, much richer experience. If you want quick coffee from a place like Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks or Aroma you have no shortage of options. But if you want hand crafted coffee treated with skill go to Taylor St. Chat them up and see if it doesn't become a part of your daily routine.

All the syrups are made in house so everything is less sweet, just to my liking. You can choose to get non dairy milks: almond, oat, and macadamia.  My friend and I went with the space oddity with macadamia milk (lol so hipster). I didn't particularly like the milk and couldn't taste the rose, maybe due to the choice of milk.

The barrista was impossibly polite and positive, matching the vibe of the cups (see attached photo). He gave me a free sample of the daily roast, which was appreciated.

I inquired into their different types of lattes and he was very descriptive about each one. I ordered one of the naturally flavored lattes with macadamia milk, which I never had.

The Elk,4,"I profess a serious weakness for coffee shops in the West Village, a sentiment shared by the rest of the population, as demonstrated by the fact that I came here once before with my best friend on a beautiful Sunday afternoon and every single seat was taken. Especially when a cafe hits the holy trinity: free WiFi,* some amount of seating for NY standards, and working bathroom.  Although my latte was perfectly serviceable, the best thing I had all week was definitely the pistachio cardamom loaf - moist and buttery enough without being overly sticky, beautiful hint of cardamom. I did that undignified gesture of tilting the bag back so I could get all the crumbs. The barista was a sweetheart who said the slice she cut was a bit small and charged me a little less.  They won't chase you out if you choose to spend three hours here wrapped up in a book or talking to a friend but at least my rule of thumb is to buy something for every hour or so I'm at a cafe. The sun falling in from outside and the quietness of the cobble street makes this a really pretty place to get work done. Plus the food looked/smelled amazing.  *Which brings me to the laptop policy. The Elk tries to be ""fair"" and divides up the room so that, if you need to work on your laptop, you sit on the uncomfortable, backless stools to the left as you come in, while the comfier seating to the right is reserved for reading and conversations. My question is - why dis-incentivize laptop use but still offer free WiFi if people can be equally disconnected and watch stuff on their phones? Is it just the keyboard typing that's too distracting? I would disagree after sitting next to someone who refused to disable the keyboard sounds on their phone. This is all something I spend too much time ruminating about.",4,3/26/2019,4,4,5,40.73419622,-74.00747902
The Elk,4,Super cute little cafe! There are limited seating options that seem to fill up quick! I definitely recommend ordering to go because people take their time. I love the fact that they asked what type of milk you want with your latte! Sometimes I forget to say almond milk!  The kitchen is downstairs so all foods come up through a hand cranked dumbwaiter next to the barista.  The kale Caesar salad was very good!

The Elk,4,"Are we still using the word Yuppie in 2018? If so, let me say that The Elk personifies Yuppie culture more than any other coffee shop I've visited in NYC.  Formerly Mojo, a subdued coffee shop that at least harked back to prior eras, the Elk has embraced the contemporary West Village in all of its glory. Think fluorescent lighting and overly photogenic, ostensibly light and healthy food options.

Tables, stools, and people are packed into this tiny room, it feels like you're climbing on top of one another just to get your order, take a seat, or make your way to the bathroom.

If you're looking to snag a table and enjoy a coffee with some friends on a weekend morning, good luck to you: The Elk gets slammed, so I usually end up getting my drink to go. On weeknights, it turns into a more low-key, quiet space, usually with a few people getting work done on their laptops.

Today an older man was in front of me (looked like he could be in his early 80s) and spilled his (overpriced) coffee trying to get a lid on. The girl at the counter literally gave him the LOOK of DEATH and gave him the BIGGEST attitude when he asked for help. After he left she cleaned up the coffee and started complaining to her co-worker that the ""old man spilled his coffee everywhere and didn't apologize."" WTF. Who is hiring at the elk?!?!

The Elk,4,"It was so awesome exploring the gems of west village!! I saw some pictures on Yelp and decided to give the ELK a try but I think the pictures did not do the place justice. When you first walk in, you are greeted by this super homey, super earthy atmosphere. From the menu, it looked like there were more breakfast items than just Pastries. I ordered the banana chocolate chip muffin (sourced from ovenly) and a small flat white. I think the place can do a little better job at enhancing the flavor notes (it's parlor coffee cmon) but it is definitely not bad.  The muffin was a classic as usual! As I was eating I saw people next to me eating the loveliest pulled chicken sandwich and it smelled SOOO GOOD I will definitely try that next time!",4,4/12/2016,3,1,1,40.73419622,-74.00747902
The Elk,4,"First off, I must say that I've only been to The Elk a few times; upon a recent visit, I was on my way to go on a Hornblower cruise, was a tad too early to board, and wanted a chai while I waited. I got my chai, sat down at the counter, capped it, leaned down to plug my phone in to give it some juice...and proceeded to spill my chai ALL. OVER. MY. PANTS. I don't mean just a few drops. I mean if I was an elementary school student, I would have been sent to the nurse's office and my mom would have been called in to bring me dry pants. I felt so embarrassed; luckily a cute Australian patron sitting next to me, along with the wonderful and quick-thinking staff behind the counter, came to the rescue with napkins and shammies. They even gave me a new chai, which I manage to keep contained. Ha! I'm thankful for their quick thinking and the fact that they told me not to be embarrassed. Haha.  Including my singular misadventure there, I do have ample praise for The Elk. I have regular spots I normally patronize - Joe, Toby's Estate, Think Coffee - but this spot is great because it's a tad off of the beaten path, unassumingly located in a very residential section of the West Village, west of Greenwich but east of the river. Besides having chai (Harney's, at that!), they have a good coffee and drink menu (turmeric lattes!) and a small but wonderful menu; upon one visit, I wish I hadn't eaten beforehand because I wanted to dig into a neighbor's noodle bowl! It's a little cramped for space - quite popular! - and, luckily, half of the seating is reserved for non-computer use, which I appreciate.  The Elk is definitely my new West Village hideaway. I just need to be more careful with my drinks. Ha!",4,1/30/2017,1,1,1,40.73419622,-74.00747902
The Elk,4,"I have been here twice, and I would give it a five star based on my experience first time; unfortunately their service seemed to deteriorate a lot during the gap and I was very disappointed.  Asked for a skinny latte, and apparently my barista had no intention to do anything at a more premium level other than brewing my coffee. The steamed milk was being poured carelessly and present a weird shape on top of my coffee. He handed me the coffee without saying a word, not even a facial expression - so rude.  This is a different barista, so I would assume this is a one-time issue as my last barista was both helpful and lovely. But I do hope that they could work on their consistency in this aspect.",4,10/25/2016,12,7,10,40.73419622,-74.00747902

The Elk,4,"THE ELK is a quaint little coffee shop in the West Village, with five tables that are almost always occupied. The tables are laptop-free, but you're welcome to sit in the window if you need some screen time. It's a great place to station yourself for a long while (especially if you have back rest) and their food/snack options are, both flavor and presentation-wise, quite rich and somewhat extraordinary for a coffee shop. (Their tomato soup, for instance, is one of the best I've had in the city.)  The space has a strong Nordic feel, and the design, coupled with the curated magazines and small selection of home goods (candles, soap, incenses) makes you feel like you're working from a corner of The Apartment instead of a tiny coffee shop in the Village.",4,6/20/2017,0,0,0,40.73419622,-74.00747902
The Elk,4,"If this cafe isn't a ""hidden gem"" I have no idea what is.  Abutting the scenic Hudson, The Elk is a short walk from the Greenway, making it ideal for grabbing a coffee and heading down to the river, or vice versa, which is what I did. The second you walk in, you are struck by the sanded, unfinished wood aesthetic, modest succulents peppering the shelves, and the seating that hugs up against the huge street side windows. I swear these people never need to pay for lightbulbs because they are killin' the natural light game.  Anyway, aside from the fact that it looks like something you'd see in a Restoration Hardware catalogue, the Elk offers the standard selection of coffee and espresso drinks, all of which look wonderful. Definitely pair whatever you get with the chocolate chip cookie, which was one of my favorite parts about my whole experience. The barista was a hoot, too.

It's a cute spot to grab a hot drink, chit chat with friends. I was there this past Saturday, ordered a coffee without knowing that almond milk costs extra, and when I asked the girl who took my order just out of curiosity and to make sure she got the right order, her response was ""didn't you see it's on the menu"", and proceeded with a mocked laugh. Look Its not about the 75 cents or how much extra it costs. I just thought that as a consumer I would be informed if it's going to cost extra and I thought she would have reacted in a better way. And because of that I'm completely turned off by this place because hey it's NYC and there are plenty of other cute coffee spots with nicer people and good coffee.

The scene is very casual, but filled with West Village types (and your occasional celebrity considering it's location) either doing work or enjoying an intimate coffee date with a friend.  The service is usually very friendly and fast, which appropriately fits the warming vibe of the space.

Wow, they really did make it more light and airy in there; however, I kinda liked the old, shabby chic style more. There is more room to move around now, but the same amount of seating. Coffee was good. My big gripe is they have a small and large (8 vs 12 ounces) and they charge the pretty typical $2/$2.50, but you're getting less coffee.  Major plus for having lots of outlets and free wifi there. A little annoying you can't use the tables for laptops until late afternoon, though. Didn't eat any of the food but the breakfast and roasted veggie plate looked good (not sure if latter is on menu; it may just be something the employee through together). I do really, really miss those amazing cookies Mojo had...that bacon toffee cookie was absolutely delicious. The new owners should find a way to get those back!

In fact, I did have to slide them around to get a seat.  I ask for a refill.  No refills for lattes.  Thats fine.  Can I get a regular ice coffee refill?  Uh, you guess so???

Surprisingly enough, according to previous Yelp reviews, Im not the only one who noticed the big chip on your shoulder.  Anyway, Im at ""whynot coffee and wine"" writing this.

I ordered a small Iced Matcha Latte ($5), and an Almond Croissant ($4.25). But were nothing too special, but definitely good items. I liked how the Matcha Latte was not too sweet at all, as I prefer mine to still have a himt of the natural bitter Matcha flavor to it. The biggest con about this place is their paid WiFi. I came to this place to do work for ~6 hours, and I was disappointed to find that WiFi was not free. It's $2.95 for 1 hour of WiFi, which I didn't find worth at all.

They have a decent amount of food options for sandwiches and salads, gelato and desserts. They only had one or two options for scones, danish, croissants of each.

Tianti Books,4,I would give them 0 stars if I could.  I work down the street and come now and again to do work.  It's convenient that's why I have gone in the past however every time I come the employees are so incredibly rude.  This last time being the last time I will ever go.  A coworker and I came to do work for a little (let me mention that every time we are there we always buy stuff during our time)  However this time only I bought tea (which by the way a cup of tea was just short of $7 and she gave me the wrong type - but I didn't mention it)  My coworker did not want to buy anything at the moment and they asked him to leave because if he doesn't buy anything he can't stay.  We most definitely will NEVER come back since this is the 4th or 5th poor experience we've had.  Oh and the tea - not even close to being worth the $7.,4,10/8/2018,1,0,0,40.753943,-73.992609
Tianti Books,4,"Good rose tea latte, but like other reviews, the seating in the back seemed to be off-limit, so that took away a lot of points.  That left only a couple tables outside. The tea latte was also expensive compared to a regular starbucks.  I also got bitten by mosquitoes when I was sitting there reading for an hour. I was wearing shorts though.  It wasn't exactly quiet there to read books either. It was just like a regular coffee shop. I was expecting an atmosphere that was more meditating.",4,10/18/2017,0,0,0,40.753943,-73.992609

Tianti Books,4,"Cafe is cute, but I think the seating arrangement was just a bit off-putting for me. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of seats - I was just hoping for a spot along the back area, but it seems that they've been turned into or have always been conference rooms by reservation only. Just seemed by Yelp pictures that they were open for seating. Anyways, had to sit along the side of the long coffee bar as the tables in the back and front aside from the conference room areas were taken, so the place felt very narrow to me. My iced chai tea was... eh? The ice melted and it tasted... different. Wi-fi times out after 30 minutes, which is not cool since I was planning on staying for at least an hour. Music is... interesting. I'm usually not one to think much of what they play in coffee shops but the stuff they play here is not really my taste.",4,8/1/2018,0,0,0,40.753943,-73.992609

We also ordered a passion fruit macaroon to try, which had a nice texture and wasn't super sweet.

Up front is the usual setting of pastries behind glass and a coffee menu behind the counter. No one in line so quickly ordered a Latte ($4ish), Oatmeal Cookie ($2.50), and the Carrot Pound Cake ($3). Prices aren't bad, and everything was ready within a few minutes. Latte is served in a glass mug and is the perfect temperature (no sugar necessary either). Pound cake is soft with a big carrot taste. Oatmeal cookie didn't have as strong of a flavor; probably not as good because I believe it was gluten-free.

Bottom line, don't ever count on them being open in the morning. - The coffee just isn't great. I prefer Frisson (on 47th st towards 8th) for coffee and espresso or Amy's bread (around the corner on 9th) for espresso. For the price (over $5 for espresso drinks) it should be higher quality.  And now for the minor pet peeves, - It is named ""UT47 Coffee and Bread,"" but they have no bread, and the pastries are all pre-wrapped in plastic. Clearly, they don't bake them there, and I was disappointed the time I tried one. - The wifi never works - The decor in the main area looks like a nail salon. The area in the back and around the corner feels more like a coffee shop, but nothing about the place is cozy. - I've been in several times, and the owner/manager acts quite friendly, but just remember me. We've had 5 minutes conversations, then the next day, ""hi, first time in?"" - The extremely large and loud signs are just plain stupid. ""GIRL, YOU THIRSTY?""

A notes to preface my full review: I have not had coffee to-stay in UT47  UT47 recently opened up in Hell's Kitchen, so I had to step in and test it out. I stopped in for coffee and a croissant a few weeks after the cafe opened. The staff are extremely friendly and were happy to have my business. That being said, I wasn't very impressed with the coffee itself. The coffee had a watery taste to it; the price didn't live up to the product.  As I like to visit places at least twice before I review them, I recently stopped in for an iced coffee - my summer go-to. I paid $5 for a large iced coffee; the price was expensive for the size. The iced coffee was unimpressive; it tasted flat and lacked character. Still, the interior of the cafe redeems it from my mediocre coffee experiences.  The interior of the cafe is best summarized as modern, clean, and cozy. If you're looking to sit somewhere to work, I highly recommend the cafe!

2Beans,4,"I had the chance to try this 2Beans location in midtown while catching up with a friend who was visiting the city. I've walked by it a handful of times but never had the opportunity to step inside until this experience. I was always enticed by the idea that they served coffee beverages at what looked like a typical bar seating arrangement. Regardless, I took the chance and told my friend to meet me there even though it was my first time trying out the spot. I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed.  My friend and I walked in around 5:45 PM on a Thursday afternoon. It was fairly dead at the bar on their first floor and while we were there only one other party ended up walking into the space. They also had an interesting set up in which they allowed us to sit at the bar and order our drinks there before paying for them. This was definitely a more casual bar-esq setting than most coffee shops in the city claim to be.  My friend and I both ordered their ice coffee ($4.45) which was presented to us on a tray with accompanying water and a small chocolate. So surprising! It's definitely the small things that count at restaurants and cafes and even though this wasn't too monumental of a gesture it definitely was appreciated.  The space itself is actually two floors with a small main bar on the first and additional seating on the second. They have an array of coffee products placed throughout the first floor that you're able to buy as well.  The service was great here too! The barista's were extremely friendly and didn't hesitate to answer any questions we had. I'd definitely recommend the spot if you're looking for a more unique place to grab coffee with a friend at. They also have alcoholic beverages that you can order as well if you're in the mood for something with a little bit more kick than your average cup of joe.",5,7/6/2018,2,0,0,40.7511373,-73.978866

It has just the perfect amount of sweetness. I love to have this drink when I am stressing out at work, it helps calm my mind down.  Matcha Latte. It uses Ito En's matcha powder, a Japanese tea brand. Its bitter-sweetness is just the perfect combination for my taste buds.  Rosewater Latte. This is probably my ultimate favorite drink here - hot or iced. Perfect amount of fruity sweetness for my taste buds. A must-try!  There are coffee bar seats and tables located in the back.

2Beans,4,"As part of my commute home, I've walked past 2beans barely noticing what it was until one day I looked closer and saw it was a cafe, so I decided to try it.  When I walked in I knew this place was inappropriately named as their abundant chocolate selections take up nearly half the 1st floor!  I'm thinking to myself...get ready for something tasty.  I decided to forgo the retail store section which is filled with many different chocolate bars, chocolate pastries, and chocolate candies, and head to the cafe section.  I ordered a regular large cup of coffee and one of the multitude of delicious looking fresh pastries in the form of a nutella tart.  Shockingly I've never tasted illy coffee and after tasting it I couldn't help but be a little sad in realizing what I was missing for most of my life.  It was great coffee; a very nice mild soothing blend that calmed my caffeine cravings.  I had the nutella tart and it was an perfect accouplement to the illy coffee; not too sweet, nice outer crust, and just large enough to satisfy most people.  A really nice touch as part of the eat-in service is that 2beans supplies a nice complimentary cinnamon crumble bar and a small glass of water with orders.  The water really helps clear your palette after a cup of coffee; something I do normally anyways.  Speaking of the eat-in service, you have the choice of eating at the ""bar"" counter or going to the 2nd floor.  I suggest the 2nd floor as it was nicely decorated in simple modern comfy furniture (love-seats and comfy couches) and neutral colors; think of it as an upscale IKEA look.  Prices weren't too bad considering 2beans is located in midtown Manhattan adjacent to many financial and law firms.  2beans has plenty of competition though considering the prolific number of cafes and Starbucks in the area (yes, hedge fund gurus and attorneys crave caffeine).",5,6/30/2014,4,4,6,40.7511373,-73.978866

2Beans,4,"The disclaimer:  I work in the coffee industry.  I'm not to going to write any bad reviews on coffee shops - I'll keep those opinions to myself.  Nor will I write about anyone that I do business with, or even might do business with.  So when I do write a coffee-related review, it will be a positive review, and one I write with an especially critical eye.  I stopped in here unscheduled, killing some time before a meeting in midtown.  What a lovely surprise.  The entrance could be tricky - after passing thru the outside door, you could go left or right - turn left.  The long space formed by shelving will take you past displays of dainty chocolates and other temptations.    Turn right at the end of Decadence Alley, and the coffee bar reveals itself - sleek and modern.  I ordered a Guatemalan pour-over, and it was perfect.  The barista politely let me know it would take a few minutes to prepare, and was courteous and pleasant.  She did a great job with the pour-over.  All the subtle notes of the coffee came thru, and the blueberry muffin was an excellent accompaniment, not too sweet, between dry and moist, and dusted with a light sugar/flour thing.    There's additional seating upstairs, and the bathroom downstairs was clean - at the end of the morning rush, or about 9:30am, no mean feat.  (People are just pigs sometimes.  I used to clean the bathrooms when I was a dishwasher in college.  I've SEEN some things that I will never unsee.)  There's a whole bunch of other stuff to buy, in an efficiently used space - a fridge case of cool beverages (get it?), yogurts, and other stuff.  The place isn't a machine, and you could tell that - the staff is working hard and customizing their roles - trading off tasks.  This might slow things down a bit at times, but it didn't when I was there, and makes it seem like a small shop rather than a franchise unit.  Depends what you want.  I'm looking forward to going back.",5,2/27/2016,0,0,0,40.7511373,-73.978866

2Beans,4,"I'm a Star Trek fan so this reference probably will make most sense to geeks out there like me.  In the movie ""Generations"" (the one where they kill off Captain Kirk), the movie starts with the new Enterprise going for a short ride around the solar system to show off to the press.  Then they face a real emergency and half the equipment they need to deal with it isn't onboard yet.  The crew is competent, the ship is a good one, but it was still new and needed some tweaking before it got better.  That's how I feel about my first visit to 2 Beans.  It's definitely got the DNA of a good coffee/chocolate place.  It is an absolutely GORGEOUS space.  I felt like I was walking into some high priced bar or restaurant, not a coffee/chocolate joint.  There is liberal use of elegant looking dark wood shelves, a lot of clear glass in the design and a really nice looking lounge area upstairs.  Near the entrance is a counter seating area that really looks cool enough to be something out of a movie.  The product they stock is attractive (ranging from prepackaged to fresh chocolates) and they use an iPad based system for their registers, which is where I'm convinced things are going more and more in the future.  2 Beans appears to serve ""illy"" brand coffee (if my cup is any indication) which I enjoy.  I had an Americano made and it came piping hot and it was tasty.  Not watered down at all, smooth with nice flavor.  The folks behind the counter were eager to please for sure and drinks were made with good speed.  I'm deliberately front loading all the positive stuff about ""2 Beans"" first because I believe it has great potential to be a cool spot, but there were some glitches which I ascribe to ""first month growing pains"".  First, the layout of the place is really odd.  The area for people to stand on line is really small because a ginormous shelf of packaged goods blocks off some standing room.  If there's only say, 6-7 people on line that's fine.  But if this place takes off, they're going to have lines out the door.  You hang a left when that shelf ends and there's the chocolate bar, but it's practically hidden.  I felt like I had just discovered a secret room in a video game (by the way, the chocolate bar is beautiful, well worth checking out).  Just as you hang that left is a tiny, tiny station for putting sugar (or your preferred substitute) and milk into your drink.  The problem is, there's barely any room to do it.  One guy and I were practically elbowing each other trying to get our coffees taken care of.  Second, the organization needs a bit of work.  I'm very used to my beloved Gregory's Coffee.  You go in, order, the order is yelled out and it's taken care of a few steps down.  Here, the cashier's station wasn't working, so she had to keep running to another station to make change or run cards.  Then while she was gone, one barista was making a drink while another young man was hustling some type of to-go order, leaving me and about three people just standing there a bit befuddled.  Finally my order was taken, and once it was it came out super quick.  Third, there were just a couple weird moments.  First, I took a pic of the chocolate bar and asked when they opened.  The gent there started telling me, and then asked if I worked for a competitor.  Erf?  Then when I asked for a sleeve for my very hot cup, the gentleman behind the counter (different guy) offered me one, but assured me the cup was a ""double layered"" cup that shouldn't need a sleeve, but if needed one I could have one.  I wasn't so much put off by these things as I was confused because I've never encountered them at another coffee shop.  As I said in the beginning of this review, there's great potential here and I'll even go so far as to say I'll give this joint 2.5 stars right off the bat.  I intend to wait a few weeks, let them settle in and then go back for a follow up visit some time.  Fingers crossed as I always like having another elegant choice for coffee in the area!",5,8/16/2017,0,0,0,40.7511373,-73.978866
2Beans,4,"This is located in the middle of 40th and 41st. I can see why people can miss it, since there's no flag or sign outside the entrance and it's part of an office building.  Once you pass the initial threshold, left is the chocolate shop and right is the cafe.  I didnt't purchase any chocolate items, but I did notice the detail and exquisiteness of the individual pieces. They looked like they would be great gifts.  I ordered the Lavender Coffee Latte and a slice of cheesecake. I think the presentation of both were amazing. The latte had a pretty leaf design on top, and the cheesecake was drizzled with caramel and whipped cream on the side. Taste wise.... the latte had a hint of a hint of lavender - the drink itself was light and airy, but I wish I could have tasted more of the lavender. The cheesecake tasted like it was made some time ago - it was very thick. It wasn't dense and rich; the cake had more of a rubbery feeling. There was also no crust to it, no sweet taste, and no flavor.  There is seating upstairs - I like how it overlooks the cafe and the outside but I didn't particular like sitting at one of the two huge rectangular tables, having to share the space with others. It was a bit awkward. There are 3-4 individual sofas and then padded seating lining the other side, but there were no tables, so it was basically just a long seat that none of the customers chose to sit at bc of the lack of a place to put down their coffee.  The servers are friendly, and I'm sure if you work around here, it's a convenient and decent place to go to. Maybe not for someone like me.",5,12/22/2016,0,0,0,40.7511373,-73.978866

2Beans,4,"My director suggested 2Beans for a place to study as it has a spacious upstairs seating area and strong coffee. I think it's also important to point out the large selection of chocolates you can find at 2Beans.  The level of excitement 2Beans will bring to a chocolate enthusiast is comparable to a child's reaction to FAO Schwarz. The tall walls are stacked with chocolates from various regions and there is always a staff member who is eager to answer any questions. Every time I've wandered in between the chocolate aisles, I've been asked if I had any questions or needed any help finding something in particular. I wanted a nice dark chocolate and was recommended the 88% dark chocolate from Beschle. I also purchased a sea salt and pistachio flavor from the same brand. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate but 2Beans makes me want to try all the exotic flavors they have in stock.  I'm actually a fan of illy espresso so I really enjoyed the strong soy latte I ordered, as well as the free piece of chocolate I got with it. The cups used are also apparently served in compostable cups that look plastic but are actually made from natural sugars? I had no issues with the staff. It did take some time to get my latte and two of the female workers were speaking a lot in spanish..but they got the order out. I also saw someone who appeared to be the store manager overlooking the business.  The upstairs is very spacious with two large communal tables (great for group meetings), comfy couches, small tables, a fireplace, and tvs. There is also an office on the top floor which I found odd and noticed a lot of activity inside. The only con is that all outlets have been blocked off from public use so it is an inconvenience if you are working on a laptop or need to charge your phone (if you're desperate, there's an outlet in the bathroom downstairs, which is kept clean).  Overall, I found 2Beans to be a great spot for business meetings, study groups, catch ups, or even dates. Come by if you're in the Grand Central area!",5,9/28/2016,0,0,0,40.7511373,-73.978866

I was with a 2 other people at a table upstairs and my 2 guests had to leave so I stayed to finish my coffee.  Barely 5 minutes had passed and my glass was still not empty and the sever asks me when I'm leaving because people are waiting but oh I'm not trying to rush you out. It's quite obvious I'm not finished and because she and another employee kept staring and eventually walking by I felt clearly unwelcomed so I decided to leave. The worst part was there were other tables open! Not even the slightest mention of this or asking if I wouldn't mind being sat downstairs.

It was decent, but I might try something else next time. The coffee bar area looks chic, great for chatting with friends and enjoying the weather. There's also an area for chocolate and random treats & drinks, but I don't care for it.. I feel like it'd be more practical if they turned it into a seating area as well LOL just saying.

Her son and I both ordered hot chocolates.  However, we were told that only ONE of us could have hot chocolate, becuase there is only enough left for ONE serving.  To get more, we would have to wait 15 minutes.  I've never heard of a coffee shop running out of one of their drinks at 1pm.  I didn't feel like waiting 15 minutes for one cup of hot chocolate, so I ordered a Mocha instead.  Similar enough.  My mocha was delicious, if a little small.  They use super-skinny glasses which look impressive but don't fit much actual liquid in them.  The whipped cream on the top was more voluminous than the Mocha liquid.  But it definitely was good.  We enjoyed the upstairs seating area.  Plenty of room for all.  One girl was taking advantage of the space to study from her laptop.

2Beans,4,"ADHD Summary:  A great pit stop when you need a place to sit in style near grand central.  European in style and speed. Great coffee and chocolates.  Speed: I get you came here for caffeine, but one look and you know they are not going to be as fast as the main stream places.  If you're in a hurry, this isn't your place.  If you have a little time or are meeting someone to talk, perfect.  The Coffee: It's good to go. They have soy milk and it isn't Vanilla flavored. I'm happy.  If you order and stay, I love the cups and the way they do the heart shaped topping.  Cafe au lait is very au Lait.  The seasonal coffee specials are quite nice.  The atmosphere: Upstairs has additional seating if you find the bar too cold as the door opens to it and you get a bit more wind than you'd expect in the winter.  It's very trendy.  Even the bathroom is Italian decorated. It is definitely like a bar in here, including the singles scene, though perhaps there is something to be said for a full lighting, sober approach attempt.  The Chocolate:  They definitely do carry some of the more high end brands for chocolate. I was excited as sometimes it's hard to find (Valhora, Charbonnel et Walker).  If you're needing a last minute gift, these are all really perfect.",5,3/9/2013,6,0,2,40.7511373,-73.978866
2Beans,4,"This place is pretty good! I got my drink and pastry to stay upstairs. If I hadn't read reviews before I went, I wouldn't have known it was waiter service upstairs. I really would've preferred to grab my drink and food and bring it upstairs myself. There was one waitress for the upstairs area which I guess was fine because it's not that large. They have a nice variation of tables, single comfy chairs, and half booths. I got a hazelnut hot latte with soy milk and a small almost croissant. The latte had a good taste, but it wasn't that hot but that was fine with me. I actually think it was a chocolate latte judging by the taste but that was fine with me bcuz it was good regardless. The croissant was not good. It was very hard and not soft and flaky so I didn't wind up eating a lot of it. I was brought my drink and food along with a small cup of ice water and a piece of dark chocolate which I appreciated. The total for the drink and croissant was around $9.50 (which is not including tip). It was a little expensive but I knew so walking into the place. I may come back again, but possibly get the latte to go since the taste was great. The one thing I thought was odd was that since the wifi was locked, I asked the waitress for the password and she put the password in my phone herself instead of telling me the password.

The sit-down area is definitely a commodity since the Starbucks a couple of yards down the street is always crowded.  The menu item that caught my eye was the Viennese espresso that's supposed to be espresso with melted chocolate and whipped cream. About $4. Been to Austria. Had Viennese espresso.

Bird & Branch,4.5,"Innovative drinks for coffee and non-coffee drinkers, freshly baked kouign amanns, croissants, teas, unique toasts, friendly staff-- this coffee shop has something for everyone!  I've been here ~3 times, and have tried several items: - Nori Avocado Toast 5/5, lots of umami flavor - Blackbird 5/5 espresso with macadamia milk and blackberry jam, not overly sweet, lactose-intolerant friendly. I am not a coffee drinker, but this espresso is so good, that I willingly compromise my non-coffee drinking identity :) - Matcha Latte w oat milk 5/5, standard matcha latte but their oat milk is made in house and delicious - Sparrow 5/5 sparkling hojicha. If you like a refreshing tea, this is the perfect coffee alternative. - Chocolate orange kouign amann: 5/5 so good that writing about it has already made my mouth water  My only qualm to this coffee shop is that there is no restroom, but I'm usually able to sneak into a restroom across the street or around the corner.  Definitely will be back. Thanks Bird & Branch!",5,4/12/2019,1,0,0,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,4.5,"Come here for seriously inventive coffee/tea drinks and incredibly friendly service. My fianc̩ and I popped in here and were blown away at the options; will definitely have to come back to try the food. They have the basics when it comes to coffee drinks if you're in the mood for something simple but I recommend the drinks that you probably won't find in other cafes.  Of their signature drinks, we tried the: The starling, which was a carbonated and cold-brewed hojicha. The flavor actually was quite strong and, while I wouldn't automatically assume that hojicha would taste that good carbonated, it was delicious.  The sparrow, which was espresso, lemon, and carbonated water. Again, I didn't think espresso and lemon would pair together but it was an interesting taste that grows on your tongue.  The owners were behind the counter making the drinks. When I was poring over the menu, the owner offered a small sample of the starling for me to try. Very thoughtful!  Nice, soothing decor (including a mural of preserved plants that the owner made herself). Definitely want to come again.",5,4/8/2019,10,1,10,40.7603019,-73.9907769

B&B was introduced to me by a coworker that lives in Manhattan.  I will go out of my way (like 10 blocks out of my way) to go here just for a coffee.  I have tried basically every coffee drink on the menu and I have not been let down once.  The only negative is the size of the shop, but it is NYC, nothing is big, except the prices (but this place is not expensive)!  They have a great seating area outside as well, so if you are lucky enough to grab a seat, grab it and enjoy watching the city go by.  This is definitely a place to check out though, but make sure you allow yourself a little time, good coffee doesn't just get thrown at you (like at Starbucks, yuck!).",5,4/19/2019,0,0,0,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,4.5,"This is a well deserved 5 stars. Everything from quality, service, uniqueness, and ambiance!! And that's coming from a coffee snob who's been trying a couple new coffee spots each weekend.  I got the blackbird which included thyme and blackberries in a cappuccino-like form. 10/10. My husband got the coffee flight, and the employees even brought the flight over to where we were sitting, explained each bean within each flight of espresso. Huge fan of the Burundi espresso bean, it had floral/fruity undertone like nothing we had ever tried before! Would come back and by just the beans too.  AND their food was sooo fresh and yummy. The nori avocado toast was delicious, it's topped with sesame to give an extra boost of flavor.  Honestly, I was a die hard Blue Bottle coffee drinker as it's two blocks from where I live, but I think this place is now right up there (plus they offer more unique coffees if you're looking to spice up your weekend coffee!).  Price was comparable to other coffee shops. But if I had to choose between a $6 coffee at Starbucks or Bird & Branch, hands down it would be bird and branch!!",5,3/2/2019,3,0,1,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,4.5,"One of my favorite cafes in New York! The owners are extremely knowledgeable but still very approachable if you have any questions about the menu (or about how they started this cafe). The cafe itself is small but has a cute outdoor seating area and if you are able to snag a seat inside the ambiance is very cozy and tranquil.  In terms of drinks, I've ordered the iced matcha latte, the blackbird, and the nightingale. Their specialty drinks (named after different birds) including their seasonal ones are sometimes hit or miss depending on your palette and tolerance for experimental flavors, but I've liked every one that I've tried so far.  In terms of food, I'm blown away every time. I've tried kouign-amann, fig & cheese danish, and yuzu ricotta toast and the flavors of each have been absolutely wonderful.

Saint Frank coffee roasters (San Francisco), currently they're using the Guatemala single origin for espresso drinks. Nice to find a different toaster because NY is dominated usually by the same coffee beans.  Staff are nice. Space is very cute and attention to detail for the decor.

Bird & Branch,4.5,"I can't believe a quality neighborhood cafe as good as this exists just blocks away from the Times Square/Port Authority madness! What a fantastic spot for delicious drinks and lighter fare.  Their signature drinks are really cool, with lots of interesting ingredients for a little variety from the norm. I tried the blackbird, which has to be one of the most unusual and delicious lattes I've had. I believe blackberries made their way into the mix (the ingredients are listed in the store), giving it a fruity, tart flavor under the creamy latte texture. Really good stuff!  I also had a cappuccino, which was delicious; very smooth without any bitterness. It seems like the cafe prides itself on its coffee, going so far as to offer flights so you can taste all the different beans being used. The staff (owners?) who helped me out were incredibly kind and happy to talk about their products in a helpful way.

The baristas were super friendly and nice. I got the earl grey tea and nori avocado toast. I was surprised by how good the avocado toast was! I also bought a shirt and reusable cup because they were so cute. I also really appreciated the small efforts they made to be more environmentally friendly, like using metal straws for drinks and having separate compartments for trash, compost, plastic, and etc. Wish I can come back if I'm ever in New York again!",5,3/10/2019,0,0,0,40.7603019,-73.9907769

I actually didn't get to try their Nori Avocado toast because they didn't have avocados when I came in, but the Miso Hummus was so good! I usually don't eat tomatoes (hate it), but it went so well with the miso hummus that I left no tomatoes behind. The thick toast was topped with miso hummus (very flavorful), tomatoes, and olive oil. It's perfect-- I wouldn't change a thing!  I also ordered the Yuzu Ricotta toast, which was very light in flavor. The yuzu topping was slightly sweet, and I think I could've used more yuzu on my toast, but overall this wasn't bad. If I had to pick just one toast, I would go with the Miso Hummus.  I love all things matcha and black sesame so of course I ordered both brownies! The matcha and black sesame brownies were denser than a regular brownie, but I really enjoyed the flavor!",5,11/23/2018,1,0,2,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,4.5,Tried this place out on Sunday while I was in nyc and was really impressed!

The americano was strong and hit the spot! And the chia yogurt was really good! I wanted to take some for the road. We also tried the kouign-Amann which was delicious! It was sweet and flaky.

Bird & Branch,4.5,"I almost don't want to review Bird & Branch for purely selfish reasons like keeping this hidden gem to myself, but I'm trying to be a better person in 2019, so here we go. Reasons why it's my go-to westside reco:  - Convenient location for locals and tourists alike (more about this below) - Beautiful and unique crafted drinks that don't forgo quality - Plenty of seating (at least 10 high and low barstools with two window benches which seat 2-3 each), lots of green plants, high ceiling, natural lighting, low jazz comfort music in the background  Location-wise I've found Bird & Branch to attract a hybrid of both locals and tourists. It's just far enough from all of the Broadway theaters to offer a quiet break and regrouping away from the insanity that is Times Square and yet The Spot Next Door for locals. As a local myself, I'm not sure how this balance was struck, but it works.  Seating: The little bar stool seats are perfect for families, especially those with kids. I've seen folks from out of town wheel their suitcases in and park them under the high bar stool area. There's even room for small to medium sized groups (book clubs, youth groups, etc.) around 3-5 ppl during off-peak hours. You can tell the owners of this shop were very intentional and thoughtful of creating an inclusive space for The People.  Drinks: 1. I love love love love love LOVE the Robin. Can I say that again? I love the Robin. It's got no caffeine (say what?!) BUT the soothingness and the rich balance of turmeric, ginger, cayenne, and milk bring to my throat is unbelievable - especially during a long fought battle with a never-ending cough or mid-winter ""I just want to feel warmth again"" feels. Get this if your throat wants to be hugged by a blanket of love. 2. Seasonals: The Parakeet. Tried, tasted, was surprised, did not love, finished.. and still unsure whether I enjoyed it or felt obligated to drink cause I paid money. It's a unique drink for sure - pineapple (most prominent taste) + mulled cider + spices. Nice on the throat, but if you're going for that, you may as well stick with the Robin. 3. Also a seasonal drink: The Wren. If you like peanut butter, this is you! Be forewarned though - this drink has salt, not sugar. It's not your Reese's Pieces. And the serving size is on the smaller side.  Final words: As with all places, there are some downsides ya'll should know about: - Not a cheap coffee stop, but hey, it's Manhattan - No bathroom for customers. Kind of stinks, but they've got to make money too! Can't have people hanging around all day.",5,1/20/2019,3,3,2,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,4.5,"Coffee shops in NYC are a dime a dozen. Every few blocks you find one, and I don't even mean Starbucks which I avoid unless in need of the loo. A long time Hell's Kitchen'er, I've been eating at El Rancho (yelp.com/biz/el-rancho-b?) for years, formerly La Paloma Burritos before they had a fire and remodeled. In my humble opinion they've got the best cheap burritos in town. Plus they are a BYOB establishment, as long as you're 21 of course.  I'm a bit late in the game here, but the other day I visited Bird & Branch with my mom to have some java. It was her recommendation as she said she loves the place. It opened in Feb 2018 and I just haven't made my way over till now, although I've walked by it several times. It's a cute, clean, friendly little cafe and I see why she likes it. I had one of their special season features called 'The Wren'. It was absolutely delicious. My mom's Almond Macadamia Milk Latte was spot on too. Our barista Alex was really nice and told us that the place is the child of Faith and Brandon, a married couple that I think live in Hell's Kitchen.  There's a few tables to sit at and they have wifi, but it ain't Starbucks so don't plop yourself down to stay and surf the net all day nursing one Cup of Joe. They don't have a public restroom, but there's one right next door at El Rancho that they'll probably let you use.  In the summer Bird & Branch has a nice long wooden bench set up outside to sit at. I'll sure I'll be doing some coffee lounging there come summertime. Definitely worth checking this place out if you haven't already.",5,1/28/2019,1,1,1,40.7603019,-73.9907769

The cappuccino was very smooth but the flat white was a little sour, not sure if it was because of the almond milk but it felt a bit off. There are a few tables, probably able to fit maximum 10 people, which is relatively normal for an NYC cafe. Very clean set up and friendly staff!",5,1/20/2019,1,0,1,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,4.5,"Never heard of Bird & Branch so when I passed by, I felt compelled to check it out.  This immaculate little cafe serves nibbles and beverages. I was browsing the menu when the barista had given a sample of the Starling iced tea (sencha tea that is cold brewed and carbonated) to a customer.  He had done so because it had quite the unusual flavor. Not all taste buds will go for it.  He also offered me a try and of course, could not refuse. I instantly liked it whereupon the other customer passed and ordered something more traditional. Fear not, they serve  familiar foods and beverages.  I went ahead and ordered the Starling. Two sizes---$5.50 for 16 oz or $6.00 for 20 oz. Yes, kind of steep. I thought it was very good especially since it was slightly carbonated. Also for sample were their spicy brownies which were very good.  I only ordered a beverage but they serve baked goods and sandwiches, coffee and tea. Also available was a refrigerated section containing other bottled beverages and chia puddings, etc.  Cute.",5,8/10/2018,27,16,24,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,4.5,"Bird & Branch is one of my new favorite spots in the city!!  I came here for a Yelp event, where I was able to try a variety of their desserts and their single origin coffees. Everything was absolutely wonderful! I particularly loved their Columbian coffee. As far as their desserts go, everything was delicious. My favorites were definitely the black sesame square (I'm admittedly biased; black sesame is my favorite dessert flavor by far!), their spicy chocolate brownie (actually spicy!), and the peanut butter chocolate cookie. I'd definitely order any one of these (or all, if we are being realistic and you promise not to judge) next time I come back here. The matcha square and ginger molasses cookie were also great.  I loved everything so much that I stayed after the event and ordered some more things from the menu! They make their own almond macadamia nut milk and it's to die for. I had their almond macadamia milk latte. I normally am a black coffee drinker and don't really ""do"" lattes, but this was one of the best things I've ever tried. Not too sweet at all. If this is your first time here, I highly recommend this drink!  Outside of having phenomenal coffee and desserts, the staff really stands out. Everyone is very knowledgable and passionate about what they do. The atmosphere is very small and cozy and incredibly popular in the neighborhood.  It's a must try. I'll come back whenever I'm in the area for sure, and would even travel out of my way just to come here.",5,8/15/2018,6,2,4,40.7603019,-73.9907769

It's a 5 min walk from my office so I take ALL my walking meetings here. Now some coworkers love coming here too (spreading the word one meeting at a time)! It's such a sanctuary in this hellhole of time square/midtown (gotta say it like it is). I also sometimes go to the dance studio across the street so this cafe is just super convenient for all purposes. The interior is nicely decorated with enough space for probably ~10 people and they have wifi in case you want to work. The owners/workers are all super nice and pleasant.  I've head the matcha latte, matcha affagato, the sparrow, and the blackbird so far. The matcha affagato rivals the one you can get at Bluesone and the Blackbird is my favorite non matcha drink so far. I don't drink too much coffee but it gives me a nice kick and it's not too bitter. Prices are the expected $5-7 for coffee drinks in NYC (insert cry empty wallet emoji) and a little less for tea. They also have some pastries which I haven't tried before. I did sample their chocolate brownie once and didn't know it was spicy lol.  Overall, great vibes. The best cafe I've found in this area.

I think what really makes these place is the vibe and minimalistic decorations. It is such a cool coffee shop feel with nice owners.  I had the almond macadamia milk latt̬ iced.

The theater district is not the most relaxing area to hang out given the large number of tourists and all of the hustle and bustle, so we walked west and ran into Bird & Branch. It's close enough to the theaters to grab a quick coffee/tea/latte before a show, but feels sufficiently out-of-the-way enough to allow for a nice and quite chat with a friend. I ordered ""the robin"" which is essentially a tumeric and ginger latte. It was smooth, not too sweet, and had a nice spicy kick to it.

The only issue: 3 of the 4 times I've ordered tea, the baristas have grabbed the entire tea bag in their hands after ringing me up (instead of just holding the tea bag by the string); that's not sanitary and in my experience in coffee shops, baristas are explicitly told not to pick up the tea bags like that.

When we asked if we could try the house made almond macadamia milk, he was eager to give us a small shot to try before we buy. The milk is so nice and creamy, sweetened with dates rather than sugar!  We ordered matcha lattes with the sesame brownie. The lattes are a good balance of milk and matcha and very smooth.  Definitely try the black sesame brownie!

Their bakes goods are amazing. I got the pleasure to try the matcha cakes, sesame cake, chocolate with spice in it! yess you read that right. This was so unique, as the chocolate melts in your mouth, the spice will kick right in. My fav was matcha cake. Don't miss it. And don't miss this place. Thanks to the yelp team and Rafi, otherwise i would have taken ages to discover this  gem.",5,8/13/2018,7,1,5,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,4.5,"Got off the bus at Port Authority & needed a coffee or something matcha badly. Found this new & pretty cafe on Yelp & decided to check it out, as their menu looked interesting.  1st impression, the place is unassuming & just off the Avenue of Hell's Kitchen, on a quite tree-lined block. Their BEAUTIFUL parking spot public seating ""installation"" is a work of art. I sense a West Coast influence? A former architect/artist? Their space is sunny & spacious, with a small high top counter & 2 small seating areas at both windows. Great Design- everything's pale pink & white with clean angles & pops of greenery. Their octagon white tile coffee table looks homemade, fitting the short danish?-style stools perfectly. Their small retail section is interesting to look at & shows a #zerowaste mindset. The garbage sorting/sugar/untensil area is Amazing. Can you come to my house & make me one please?  The owners seemed to put in a lot of care and hard work into the business. The menu also reflects that, with a tumeric latte, good coffee, fig & cheese danish, earl grey & black sesame shortbread cookies, and strawberry & pistachio kouign amman, chia cups, to name a few. (They are displayed in clear glass boxes that you'd probably find at the Anthropology jewelry section.) The staff was very nice & patient. They seemed to already have regulars, with cute dogs.  However, my lower review is about the product. I appreciate the quality in The matcha brownie ($3) was dense. But it was *too* intense, I guess that's why they have small bags of brownie ""ends"" for sale, scared to eat that whole brownie! It tastes more like a blondie with matcha notes at the end. Left mouth feeling dry/tart in the way good matcha does. The Blackbird latte ($6) was tasty at first impression, coffee was strong & nutty, you can taste hints of blackberry & a hint of herbal, (not sure about the sprinkles of dried thyme on top though) a few crushed seeds at the bottom of the cup. But the homemade almond macadamia nut milk they use (like heavy cream) was *too* heavy after a few sips & a bit nauseating. The initial coffee & sweetness seemed to disappear & I was mostly tasting creamy stuff. Later on when the ice melted, it was easier to drink, but by then it tasted like a regular latte.  The pricing is higher that what I would normally pay for similar items (well- never had a matcha brownie before!), & I'm sure to to cover all the extra work for quality ingredients (squeezing all those nuts!) and manhattan location. I would only visit Branch & Bird as a special treat & very rarely. I hope they do well though, really great ideas & attention detail, nice staff. But only a rare return visit from me.

Bird & Branch,4.5,"I came here with a friend after having lunch nearby. I wasn't expecting much in terms of cuteness for the place, but it was actually really cute! There is outdoor seating and the place serves the drinks with reusable straws. Their inside could be brightened a bit more with natural lighting, but the decorations are still pink and pretty. As for the drinks themselves, I'm not a huge fan but I don't hate them. It's something that's good enough to get through a hot summer day.

Bird & Branch,4.5,"This place is so ridiculously cute. Think pinterest and your favorite insta-blogger combined! It's kind of a small shop, and there's not a ton of seating, so it's not a great place to work, but if you can snag a seat, it's very cozy.  The staff were very nice, and didn't make you feel like they were just trying to hustle you through (but they were still efficient!).  I got the iced macadamia almond milk latte, it was a little over $6 for what seemed to be about 16oz. Seems about right for the neighborhood since they're an independent shop. It was a good latte, but not very remarkable, I guess I just wanted more out of it.

They whisk their matcha powder with hot water which is what is traditionally and supposed to be done instead of stirring. I haven't tried other espresso items on their menu, but my mom has tried their latte and loves it! Their space is a bit tight, but there are a few tables here and there for working, but it's a little awkward staring straight behind the counter to the baristas/owners (haha).

Definitely do the coffee flight if you can, to get a sampling of the offerings. Add some dessert or croissants and your day is set.

Black Press Coffee,4.5,"Points for fresh clean dogwater outside the shop on a summer's day! In fact, a hot doggo was lapping some up when I arrived.  This morning was my first time here. I ordered an iced cold brew and a vegan chocolate chip cookie. Both were very good. The coffee stayed strong through some ice-melting, and I detected no bitterness. The cookie was tasty and fresh with no lack of chips, if not particularly large. (My hips thank you)  Service was friendly and quick. In my pre-caffeinated state I was unable to open the simple syrup bottle, but the barista didn't try to make me feel like the simpleton I was, instead she kindly opened it for me with a smile. :^)  My pre-tip total for the iced cold brew and the cookie was $7.25 so not cheap; but we knew that going in, didn't we? Precious Manhattan cold brew comes at a precious Manhattan price.  A bright clean slick interior; a brick wall. A pleasant and non-distracting backdrop for a superior brew.

Black Press Coffee,4.5,"A nice place to sit down and do work in, limited in seating though. Clean bathroom is a plus! Came and tried their waffle cup macchiato. I think the chocolate from the waffle cup kind of masked the espresso flavor a little bit causing it to taste more sour than bold. They can also do the waffle cup without any coffee and just a shot of milk. I wanted to sit down and get some work done so I ordered a cortado as well because the macchiato is pretty small ($5). Cortados are usually what I get when I'm in the mood for a stronger latte (aka less milk, stronger espresso flavor, or maybe even cappuccino with no foam) this did not disappoint, the espresso flavor in this was pretty strong and bold.  The barista was super nice and worked quickly. I definitely will be back if I'm around the area and craving a good cup of espresso.",5,3/23/2018,3,0,0,40.7422415,-73.9831177

A little grounds-y flavored. The stuff I normally get from the cart vendors is at least as good. And even Starbucks serves up normal coffee immediately. This place took like five minutes, which makes no sense.  I get that people like coffee in a hip environment, and I like friendly. But not me, not for $3.50 for 16oz.

I was actually just looking for a warm drink, because it was super cold outside and I yelped the nearest place around me.  The inside is small and dark with hipster vibes and there wasn't too much on the menu except coffee. But as I'm lactose intolerant, I was skimming through to find non-dairy options. They offer almond and oat milk (no soy milk), so I decided to try out the Chai tea latte with oat milk (my first time)!  It was surprisingly not bad, so me and my bf were able to finish it together before going to church! Overall, if you want a quiet, hipster moment with dark selfies, y'all should check this place out! ;)",5,10/22/2018,2,0,1,40.7531989,-73.9912442

The real reason is that the most underrated chocolate chip cookie exists in this coffee shop. It's the perfect standard textbook chocolate chip cookie. It's the chocolate chip cookie you failed to bake at home when you were a kid, the one you saw on kids shows/movies, and the one that pops in your head when I say 'chocolate chip cookie'.  If you want a really good, simple chocolate chip cookie, get this one. It's not mindboggling or one of the 'best' cookies in NYC, but we're human. Believe it or not, some days we're just not feeling an over-the-top Levain cookie rock. I call this ""The Real People's Chocolate Chip Cookie"".",5,9/26/2018,2,0,0,40.7531989,-73.9912442

Culture 36,4,"It's good to be back in NYC enjoying the hustle and bustle in another amazing coffee shop :) This is a branch of the amazing Culture Espresso, and is located along midtown-West side. Pretty close to Penn station if you're looking for a good pick-me-up in the area. This shop is a small space, but decent size for NYC. Depending on the time of day it can be busy or slow. When I arrived there was a small line and seats were filled inside. But after a few minutes of waiting I was able to get seated with a friend. There's a large glass window with booth seating to people watch or have a good convo, and there is a large table space in the center for people to do work. There are a few 2 people seating tables along the side as well for those who want a bit more privacy.  The coffee is AMAZING here. The baristas are fantastic. They make amazing espressos in a quick amount of time in the business of the lines of people. And they get their beans from Heart Coffee Roasters out in Portland, Oregon. For those of you who are still new to the coffee world - let's just sat Heart Coffee is one of the best out west, if not in the states :P I ordered a macchiato and was made to perfection :)  They are also known for their amazing Chocolate Chip cookies and Oatmeal Cranberry cookies. My friend ordered the chocolate chip cookie, and I had a few bites of it :P It was delicious! It was nice and warm on the outside, and warm and gooey on the inside with a ton of chocolate chips. Macchiato and cookie - my cup of tea. The barista also told me they won the Cookie Competition this past year..apparently it's the new cookie and better than Levain Bakery's cookie now! I have tried both and going to be honest - hard to judge which is the better cookie. All that to say, please do yourself a favor and get a cookie with your espresso drink..you won't regret it. They also have amazing baked goods around the City from places like Ceci Cela, Blue Sky Bakery, Ovenly, Dough Doughnuts, Corner Caf̩, and Magpies.  There are also two more locations in midtown-west area. I haven't checked out the other places, but imagine it's just as amazing. I'm a pretty hardcore Stumptown fan, but this might be my new fav in NYC. Love Culture Espresso and will def be having another cup of coffee and cookie during my next trip to NYC :) Always good to be back in the city that never sleeps ;D",5,12/21/2017,2,0,1,40.7531989,-73.9912442

Felix Roasting Co,4.5,"Since September 2018 Felix has been creating a buzz not only with the caffeine they serve but the aesthetically pleasing decor that includes blush and teal walls, rose gold accents, and a round wooden coffee bar.  The creators of this java oasis were not setting out to make THE most Instagammable coffee-shop in The Big Apple but rather a beautiful space for patrons to have a unique experience.  Felix is becoming known for their creative coffee creations but also the only other place you can grab Supermoon Bakehouse pastries in the city.  During my visit I ordered the hickory smoked s'mores latte which comes with a price tag of $14 and not jolt of caffeine as well.  The drink is made using their house Ethiopian coffee, and prepared inside of a graham cracker dusted rim glass and then smoked inside of a large glass bell.  If you are not in the mood for one of the coffee creations they do offer the traditional coffee beverages with a more modest price.  They offer wifi at this location but no electrical outlet, so you won't be camping out at Felix.

Felix Roasting Co,4.5,"So beautiful and so worth spending time in. I couldn't believe this place was right on Park - it seems much more Greenwich Village-y. Of course it's must appreciated for those of us who are stuck in midtown for work - a nice reprieve from the ugly!  Two drip coffees and a croissant came to $10 so prices are totally normal. Nowadays pastries run for about $4-5 and coffee at a spot like this is $2.50. Reasonable in my opinion especially given the beautiful design of this place. Also, they have different creamers on tap and don't charge extra if you opt for almond milk (or their very own nut milk).  I noticed they serve wine as well so looks like you can go with whatever you are in the mood for at Felix.  Ps- I kept the pretty paper they serve their pastries on.

This coffeeshop resells Supermoon Bakehouse baked goods: they're enormous and wonderfully delicious. I ordered a green tea croissant and flat white. The croissant was flakey and oozing with sweet custard - not too much where it was overpowering though. The flat white was tasty and rich.

Felix Roasting Co,4.5,"I am no different than any other New Yorker. I find a nice coffee shop that will allow me to sit hours on end with only buying a black coffee.  This place had me second guessing my normal routine of taking over a table and not speaking english when someone asks if I am leaving. This is the cathedral of coffee shops. The decor is stunning, I didn't want to touch anything in fear of breaking something and having to pay for it (with the 4 bucks I had in my pocket).  I asked the barista what he suggested, and to no one's surprise he picks the most expensive thing on the menu. I wasn't upset, that's just smart business. I didn't want to be that guy who chooses the least expensive, so I went with the deconstructed tonic latte. Super super fancy. This gorgeous long stem glass filled with botanicals (I could only identify the mint) filled with this smooth pink nectar that I could only suspect came from the sweat of a unicorn, with a side of some very strong espresso.  ""Sir, how do you suggest I drink this?"" ""Smell, sip, pour, swirl, drink.""  And so the adventure begins. Was it worth the $12+ I spent? Did I feel the eyes of every patron waiting to see me drink it? Were the customers on line glaring at me with my laptop on my lap?",5,12/27/2018,2,4,2,40.7449729,-73.9831812
Felix Roasting Co,4.5,"I'm convinced you won't find a more aesthetically pleasing coffee shop anywhere in New York City. This place is stunning. Most coffee shops seemingly grab some salvaged building material from a construction site in Bushwick, buy a La Marzocco espresso machine, then swing open their doors and sell you a $3.50 drip coffee. Not here. They went big, and it's something to behold.  Their decor isn't the only thing turning heads, as they make some seriously impressive coffee drinks as well. I got the deconstructed tonic espresso, and it could have easily missed the mark with ingredients I'd never consider pairing. But the result is a sweet, bitter, and aromatic beverage that was unlike anything I've ever had before. They have plenty of other interesting coffee drinks on their menu, but you should make it a priority to try this one first.  I wouldn't say it's the most comfortable place to hang if you're more into the cozy, broken-in couch type of cafe. But it's certainly a nice place to order a creative coffee drink.",5,11/19/2018,13,6,10,40.7449729,-73.9831812

It sure beats Starbucks. I did notice a lot of tourists there and the price point is much too high for me to ever seriously consider being a regular.

The cafe is spacious with high ceilings and has a warm, slightly vintage feel with the wallpapers and pastel pink & green color accents. Most importantly though, the servers/baristas are so friendly! They bring you your order if you're staying in and bring you cups of water after a little bit (this is not a full service cafe). I was here for a few hours in the morning and it was a nice place to get my work done.

Taps aside, I had an amazing flat white here the other day, one of the best cups of coffee I've had in the city to date. As has been well established, you'll be paying a premium, but the quality of the coffee makes it well worth it - the espresso was some of the smoothest i've ever had.  Also - take a look around. Designed with a central counter, plenty of seating, and decor that makes you question the fact that you're at a coffee place in midtown (in the best way), Felix makes you want to go out of your way to have a coffee to stay.

I didn't try the food, but read a bunch of other reviews about how amazing the pastries are supposed to be... and they're very unique! As far as a place to work though... wifi speeds were 500+ mb/s... outlets at every other table... easy to find a place to sit (although there aren't a ton of tables, so maybe I was just there at a slow time)... and generally nice atmosphere with friendly people working here.",5,12/23/2018,0,0,0,40.7449729,-73.9831812

Felix Roasting Co,4.5,"If you take away the hotel-ish decor, the floral velvet cushions, the Supermoon pastries, and the sparkling water on tap, the coffee here is overpriced and mediocre at best. The filtered coffee blend that they have (Ethiopia Guji Hambela) doesn't taste as extravagant as it sounds; if I had to choose between Dunkin and this, I'd pick Dunkin in a heartbeat. The fancy cocktail glass drink at most if not everyone's table? That'll be the Hickory Smoked S'mores Latte. At $14, it's a beauty and the latte art is lovely but...I expect Hickory smoke infused coffee or even a small whiff of it at minimum but NOPE. NADA. You're just paying 3x a regular latte for yours to be served in a cocktail glass + a branch + a marshmallow. Unfortunately, it's a hard pass for me so I'll be sticking with my trusty La Colombe.",5,11/16/2018,2,0,0,40.7449729,-73.9831812
Felix Roasting Co,4.5,"Forget the coffee. Just look at this place. Sure, when dating you want a thoughtful conversation with substance, but you don't turn down eye candy.  The coffee here is great. I had a flat white with their nondairy blend of nut milks. The barista made me a heart. My friend's drink came with a swan and I was immediately jealous. Thus, I posted her drink to Instagram instead.  The wallpaper, printed upholstery and mix of pink and green paint make for the perfect backdrop for photos.",5,11/17/2018,1,1,1,40.7449729,-73.9831812
Felix Roasting Co,4.5,"A colleague of mine brought this up when I was ready to go down for my normal Starbucks run. I was intrigued with this place when I heard about their raspberry croissant, but upon visiting, I came to realize that it was a special item so it was out of season.  I picked up a blueberry rosemary croissant since it was also a special menu item, but felt that the rosemary was way too powerful for the croissant. A little bit of a peculiar taste in my mouth, but the croissant was super crispy, a little burnt. Still, the texture was something that I was satisfied with. I also got a vanilla latte with their homemade almond, cashew milk.  After coming here and reading the reviews, I am definitely tempted to revisit to try out the s'mores latte. That sounds so good and it is definitely Instagram friendly!",5,11/6/2018,1,0,1,40.7449729,-73.9831812

Felix Roasting Co,4.5,Lovely location. Great vibe. The entire place is styled so well. There also seems to be a focus on good coffee. I ordered an americano and it was perfect. They also offer pastries and mine was very fresh tasting. I would recommend this place just on looks alone but I would come back for the coffee for sure.,5,10/2/2018,3,1,3,40.7449729,-73.9831812
Felix Roasting Co,4.5,"It's only been open for a couple of weeks but there's already a lot of buzz about it so I decided to check it out :)  SERVICE: Great! Everyone was friendly and helpful. You order at the counter and you can either pick it up there or they'll bring it out to you. We ordered a special drink (more on that below) that included a really cool creation process, so we stayed at the bar/counter area to watch. The barista was funny and personable and patiently walked us through the entire process.  DRINKS: my friend and I shared the hickory-smoked s'mores latte. It's pricey - $16 including tax - but it is a work of art. As I mentioned, making it is a process that includes toasting the marshmallow, smoking the entire drink and waiting for it to settle. It's made with a graham cracker-infused milk that's made in-house; the barista gave us a sample of the milk while we waited and it's amazing! I want a whole carton of it but sadly it's not for sale. Unfortunately, while the latte's presentation is beautiful, it was a bit smoky for my taste. He did mention it's a seasonal drink and they'll have different concepts for different seasons, so maybe the winter one will be more up my alley taste-wise.  DECOR/AMENITIES: this place is beautiful. Definitely Instagram-worthy and it looks more like a nice restaurant or hotel lobby than a cafe. Lots of light and open space. There are two sections: a main section in the front and a smaller, quieter section in the back (the counter is located between the sections). I saw a few people working on their laptops in the back but didn't check if there were outlets (I didn't see any in the front). They mentioned they're expecting to expand to the basement and use it as a space to host classes, coffee tastings etc in order to make the experience more interactive, so looking forward to that!  Would I go back? Yes! But I'll probably try a different, cheaper drink (and maybe one of those pastries...)",5,11/10/2018,0,0,1,40.7449729,-73.9831812
Felix Roasting Co,4.5,"This place is just as cute as everyone says it is and then some. The staff makes a point to try to get to know you, which doesn't go unnoticed.

Felix Roasting Co,4.5,"Every bit as aesthetically pleasing as you may have seen (an Instagrammer's dream!) - and that's referring to both the gorgeous seasonal Hickory-smoked S'mores Latte and the interior design of the cafe. You're paying the premium ""cocktail"" price for the extravagant presentation of concocting the latte in front of your eyes at the bar, which involves your espresso shot, dark chocolate, graham crackers, a toasted marshmallow, and smoking hickory - all ingredients apparently made in-shop (stick-whittling included!). Beautifully and mesmerizingly crafted. I would say it looks better than it tastes though (the smokiness leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste).  Can't speak to the other espresso drinks, but other patrons seemed to be enjoying them just as much! Also, any cafe that serves Supermoon pastries automatically deserves a star for that alone.",5,10/14/2018,0,0,1,40.7449729,-73.9831812

Felix Roasting Co,4.5,"From the interior, the quality of coffee, and customer service, this place has it all! Felix Roasting Co blew my mind with their unique seasonal drink, the smoked s'mores latte. Get it now before it's too late! If you're looking for something that will take your taste buds to new heights, this is the drink to try! It comes at a steep price ($13-$14), but they put on quite a show, showing you how they ""smoke out"" the drink. Their marshmallow is homemade and the milk they use in this drink is soaked in graham crackers, giving it a really rich, unique taste. I thought this drink would be too sweet, but it actually is the perfect amount. They have several small tables in the back and front of the store, but if you're looking to come with a large group (4+) on a weekend, it might be harder to snag an area without getting separated. They also get their pastries from Supermoon Bakehouse, a NYC native bakery. Free Wifi, one co-ed bathroom. Would come back again!",5,11/10/2018,0,0,0,40.7449729,-73.9831812

Felix Roasting Co,4.5,"ALLERGY ALERT - their ALMOND milk has undisclosed CASHEW. Felix Roasting was recommended to me so I arranged for a morning meeting. I went to the counter, asked if they had almond or soy milk to which they replied ""Almond milk"". No indication of cashew. I ordered a latte with almond milk. After taking a large sip with my guest, I knew immediately I was going to go into anaphylactic shock  - brought my cup to the counter and asked if there are nuts in the drink and they said oh yes there is cashew milk as well - its on the menu. First, I was not shown a menu and I verbally asked for the milk. They have spigots of milk which also, in large letters, only say ""Almond Milk"". Almonds and cashews are VERY different - this has never happened to me before with almond milk.  Thankfully my guest was very understanding and the staff refunded me immediately and gave me coffee to finish my meeting while on Benedryl. Before I left, the manager listened to my diatribe of the seriousness of allergies, promised to update the signs, and gave me an apology gift card. Its a beautiful venue that everyone should enjoy but not worth me missing the rest of the work day to sleep it off.

I really enjoyed the flavor of the coffee here. It is really good quality.  The back seating area of caf̩ is an ideal place to chill out for a coffee break.

For Five Coffee Roasters,4.5,"An unexpected oasis in the heart of Midtown.  My coworkers always come here when we want a bit of a walk, because ""getting coffee"" is never really about getting coffee, it's about taking a step off the desk, gossiping, and treating yourself. It's a step up from running across the street to Financier or Starbucks. The space is all blond wood and artsy touches, from the cafeteria-letter menu to the hip wallpaper to the graphic design of the products. Very few seats, though, and most people grab and go.  I've now worked my way through almost two punch cards, largely by getting matcha shots. This is the only source of frustration that I have-- if you're with a group and the shop is busy, they will usually put off making it until the end since it's a bit of a hassle to mix. Their matcha is good quality, though expensive at $4, so I would rather get a fancy coffee creation for $5. (Pun intended.)  I just tried the ""Five"" today-- espresso, drip coffee, chocolate, and orange peel. I like the bittersweet flavor, though it's a lot of caffeine for me.  Bonus points for occasionally giving out free samples of pastries in the afternoon.",5,7/28/2018,1,0,0,40.7578419,-73.98318389

The coffee was great, I love the layout and decor of the place, there are some tables in the back and counters all along the walls. As great as the coffee is, the staff was another story, it's not that they were bad, but they weren't very friendly or engaging. We were there on a Monday morning during off hours, it wasn't busy. I placed my order, it came out quickly, it was called out but that was about all the words exchanged, no ""hi, thanks"" nothing, look I get it if it's busy, it was not.",5,1/10/2018,1,1,0,40.7578419,-73.98318389

It's also just very convenient because it's in a great location where I can stop by on my way from port authority to my office. They're also on ritual too, so I sometimes swing by and pick up my coffee. However, the staff here is very friendly so I enjoy my experience whenever I do order in person.  For instance, one day I ordered my coffee and this purple cookie caught my eye on my way out, so I asked what it was and the barista told me it was a Cookie Monster cookie and explained how it was sugar cookie on the outside with chocolate chip cookie on the inside.

The manager has been phenomenal and welcoming every time I've gone in. The rest of the staff however lacks the same enthusiasm or even welcoming gestures. This effort to connect is important.  This coffee shop has done what many can't in the quick hustle and bustle of New York. It's not a sit down place. But it's damn good coffee. This pails in comparison to anything like Starbucks.

For Five Coffee Roasters,4.5,"There are many good things about this new business in midtown and hopefully it will be your new coffee shop to go. First of all the service: you can compare the service of this coffee shop to a 5stars hotel. I work in this kind of place so I can tell you that the service is really important ...even in a coffee shop. You are welcomed by the owners when you walk in and their enthusiasm and passion for coffee is immediately shared with you. It is great that they provided this service because you can only leave the place in good mood. They are really proud of their product and their store and will be more than happy to take the time to share their knowledge with you. Secondly the coffee shop: it is new so it is very clean and spacious. The owner was telling me about the fresque on the wall fronting the baristas desk. Drawings from an artist from New Zealand. The artist even drew the owners which I thought it was funny. In the back, they have a couple of tables. The wall is covered w/ dominos which is pretty cool. The thing that I really liked was at the Baristas desk. Their espresso can be served either wayfrom a normal espresso machine or served like draught beer. Go there to check yourself. Now the coffee and the food: I got a hot americano which was perfect with the weather. Very warm (not too hot like some place do) and delicious. I also had the chance to try their sandwich. Also very good. It is very nice place to have a quick lunch. Again the owner is very attentive to what the client wants. When he recommended me a sandwich he made sure I did not have any allergies. When you treat your client like that, you can only recommend the place to your friends and colleagues and wish them success.",5,11/1/2016,5,1,2,40.7578419,-73.98318389

Their coconut milk is also real coconut milk-none of that fake stuff Starbucks uses. The coffee/espresso is bold, flavorful, and well made. Everyone who works there that I've met has been cool/laid back/really helpful.

The ambience of the cafe is busy and busting with  energy as most of the people in the cafe are working on their laptops or socializing. The highlight of my experience was that they charge you the price of a small beverage when you bring in your own bottle, no matter what size.

I wish more coffee shops in NYC would follow their lead, I've seen this in lots of other cities, and especially overseas. We're really behind the curve here, but good thing Ground Central is around to set the bar.  I got a dirty chai latte and loved it -- slightly sweet, and I could still taste the espresso, which doesn't happen at other places that dump sugar and caffeine into a cup and hope for the best. It was a really well made drink.  The space is great, it screams ""cafe"" as soon as you walk in, with the soft lighting and dark walls. It's a great spot for working and for quiet conversation with a friend or two. There's free WiFi and quality service behind the counter.

Little outside of Times Square, we were able to find this gem.  Pretty hipster vibe with cute art drawings, dimmed lighting, and comfortable seating.  Best of all, clean bathroom!

Has a super comfy back room with ample study space, large tables and nice staff. The best part is the sort of old retro vibe you get. I felt like I was back in the 30's drinking black coffee and catching up on the latest news.  Price to experience ratio: 5/5. The atmosphere here is so dope. Considering the coffee is pretty flavorful and smooth, it makes for a solid deal. I paid $4 for a small cold brew, which is on par with other spots in the city. BUT other spots don't have this vibe.

They have a fair amount of seating (a bar by the window, a long worktable with approx. 8 seats, smaller high-top tables, and a few chairs/tables in the back ""library""). It gets crowded during the day sometimes, but in the approx. 10 times that I have been here, I have always managed to find a seat (albeit after a little bit of a wait).  By the tables in the front, they have a few outlets, but you have to be seated strategically. They also have free wifi, but I believe that only lasts an hour (they have the code by the cash register). The ""Link - NYC"" wifi also reaches the front tables and was pretty fast, if you're concerned about the wifi running out.  Their coffee is also really good. I like their lattes and they have a lot of gluten free options for pastries. I got the banana bread once, and it was fine (a little dry, but pretty typical coffee shop fare).

Also, like one of the other reviews mentioned, the music here is really dependent on who is controlling it. In the morning, it was way too loud for people trying to have conversations or study. However, the music level was fine by noon or 1pm.  My biggest qualm about this place is their food choices... They didn't have half the items on their menu all day long. Like what?? Why have them on your menu if you don't offer them???? Was pretty confused since they didn't seem that surprised or apologetic. Seems like it may be a pretty frequent occurrence that they don't have half the food menu items.  Drink I got was good and strong!",5,9/10/2018,2,1,1,40.7637495,-73.9846917

They have a lot of options and lots of milk options which is a plus! I saw macadamias milk advertised and that blew my mind!!  They also have food and salads. The interior is dark yet very fancy living room looking. I felt like I was in a living room and a university library all at the same time. They have tables  and seas right when you walk in as well as a back room with a couch and additional seats- ottomans and high back chairs. The bathroom is super clean and huge!  Just the bathroom alone is a reason for me to be a bit less loyal to Starbucks. I enjoyed my drip coffee and I felt that it gave me a serious jolt!!

They also have good selection of non-dairy milk alternatives (oat, macadamia). Atmosphere is also very nice with a lot of seating including a library like section at the back, though now so popular on weekends gets filled up!  My only complaint (and hence 1 star ding) is when taking drink orders there is no system for keeping track whose drinks is whose (name of person or number system). So when they call out large oat latte and 3 people had ordered large oat latte, there is confusion as to who was first in line and it belongs to. Please implement a person's name or numbering ordering system so it's fair FIFO principle for everyone picking up their orders.

The second time, they closed an hour early without warning, which was unexpected, because the late hours was one of the reasons to come here.  On the positive side, there is a lot of seating, and the staff is very friendly. The tea is pretty good, nothing too fancy, but definitely not outrageously expensive. It is hard to find a lot of cafe's with Wifi in and Ground Central can be pretty good if you aren't about to go deaf, just be aware when you walk in the door.",5,6/14/2018,0,2,1,40.7637495,-73.9846917

If you're hungry they sell pastries. One of my go to places to get work done, hangout, and read.  The venue is fairly large. There are sofas, long shared tables, stools on high tables, and a window bar. It's a bit noisy because it's a popular spot, but it's a conversational loudness.

I did my best to be soft spoken as well as to not to disturb others. (Someone actually complimented me on that before I left so mission accomplished!).  In regards to the coffee/food...I had a big lunch right before then so I only ordered a cold brew and was on my way. It was very strong and I enjoyed it.

Goes back quite a ways and there's window/bar seating, a large table which I worked at, and a quiet space in the back with some comfortable chairs and couches. A lot of space for this area. I had regular coffee which was piping hot and beyond decent, and an iced chai latte, which was delicious and not too sweet (closer to real chai). Didn't have any food, but it looked great and they had lots of options from baked goods to sandwiches.

However, the music was very loud and there was a couple making out aggressively for 45 minutes in the coffee shop. The staff walked by several times and didn't say anything to them.

I got a latte, my go to, and it was very delicious. I'm not much of a coffee drinker but was very impressed with how big my coffee cup was. It was 12oz and only like $5! Not to mention, the latte art was very pretty. They've got plenty of seating- a couple farm tables and some bar seating as well. When I was there, there were about ten people which was perfect because it made the location lively but not too hectic. Too often I go to a coffee shop in manhattan and it is buzzing with people with no place to sit or maneuver and you can't even hear the person sitting in front of you. Here, my neighbors were courteous and kept their voices low which makes it optimal to maybe bring a laptop and get some work done.

Nothing about this coffee shop was bad, although nothing mind blowing either. Some coffee shops have a theme that they build around; not this place. Sometimes that's a good thing, no frills. Best thing about this shop was how spacious it is, tall windows, lots of sunlight coming through midday, with two large communal tables, and about 6 stools along the bar facing the wall.

Their coffee provides that happy medium-a jolt in the morning to get you through your day, and a delicious, slightly nutty brew. It's actually tough to find a decent drip and they do it so well. The staff are really friendly and they seem passionate about the coffee they sell. It's a nice space and it's open later (around 7 I believe) than many other local coffee spots. My friends have gotten their matcha and loved it and I've also tried their hibiscus blood orange iced tea-spectacular.

Maman Nomad,4,"We walked in here on a Sunday brunch. We were seated within 10 minutes. I got their Americano, it was good. I liked the coffee. It was good. I got the Hashbrown waffle dish.  I wasn't sure what to expect really, but it's like a salad with toppings of cucumbers, a poached egg?, salmon and the waffle hash brown.  Overall, it was good, but some of the ingredients didn't mix for me. I probably wouldn't get it again.  We saw that they had some desserts, so I got the pistachio pastry and the nutty chocolate chip cookie. the chocolate chip cookie is one of Oprah's favorite things. But, personally, I enjoyed the pistachio pastry more.  If I were in the neighborhood, I'd go back for the pistachio pastry again.  It has a pistachio filling that I really enjoyed.  Overall, I liked the ambience of the place, the left side of the wall has a flowery design with a wiring shadow look. Great photo opp for the IG'ers.",5,3/6/2019,1,0,0,40.7432672,-73.9901338

The flowery interior, the cute mugs, the little spoons that come with the drinks - everything makes you feel like you are at your mother's home.  I didn't get a chance to get one of the delicious-looking bowls, so I just got an oat milk matcha. But definitely going for those warm bowls next time!",5,11/27/2018,2,1,1,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4,"Stumbled in here on a Saturday around Brunch. There's a to go area in the front of the store for coffee and baked goods, and there's a sit down area. My friend and I waited for 15 minutes and got seated at a communal table (very spacious so it wasn't a problem).  I ordered a latte, which was solid, but nothing life changing. My friend and I both got the breakfast sandwich (added chicken per the waitress's suggestions), and oh my god, I was SHOCKED. It is by far the breakfast sandwich I have ever had in my life, no doubt. The chicken itself isn't amazing, but it is an incredible addition combined with the rest of the sandwich. The bacon jam really makes the whole thing (sounds disgusting, but truly life-changing). My friend is a health nut and doesn't get carried away with enjoying food, but he also vocalized how good it was. Life changed. I will be back over and over again for this sandwich alone.  Got a raspberry rose pound bread on the way out, also very solid. I will definitely be back for the white chocolate matcha croissant, which they have every day but sells out quickly in the AM.  GET.

Maman Nomad,4,"I was a big fan of their Soho location when I lived in the area, so was really excited to check out their Flatiron outpost during a recent lunch outing, especially because I'd only ever tried their delicious baked goods and coffee, and not their real food options.  Turns out, they have a ton of great stuff for lunch, too! I couldn't resist the waffle iron hash brown bowl which came with smoked salmon, avocado, eggs, and veggies. I wished the hash browns were a tad more crispy on the outside, but other than that I was so happy with it. And the portion size was perfect! It was great washed down with their special rose matcha limeade, which was refreshing and mild, though I couldn't really taste the rose part. My dining companions got sandwiches, which they also loved, and we shared one of their gooey nutty chocolate chip cookies, which the guy behind the counter nicely let me select (I got one with lots of crispy edges).  The space is rustic and gorgeous. I could imagine some wonderful bridal showers or birthday parties happening here if they ever shut down the space for private events (not sure if they do). They definitely started to get more crowded during lunch time so an early  meal or off-hour hang is probably your best bet, but there are lots of tables to choose from.

The icing on the cake was the roaches on the walls. Two of them. They gave us a coupon for a free coffee because of the roaches.

Maman Nomad,4,"3.5 stars  I like to wear floral prints, spray floral scents on my wrist, & eat foods/drink beverages with floral elements. I couldn't decide between the Raspberry & Rose Loaf Cake slice and the White Chocolate Lavender Croissant in Maman Nomad's display case. I went for the latter & wished I'd picked the loaf. As it was later in the afternoon, the croissant wasn't super fresh. The white chocolate coating was ultra sweet & overwhelming. To improve its construction, I'd pipe some white chocolate (ganache?) & lavender inside & drizzle the same on the outside.  Despite a so-so first encounter, I'd absolutely give this adorable cafe another shot. Its decorative touches are irresistible (large spoon door handle, white & blue floral accent wall.) I'd love to spend a morning reading a few chapters, indulging in one of their caffeinated drinks, & finally trying that Raspberry & Rose loaf slice.",5,7/8/2018,3,3,3,40.7432672,-73.9901338

Maman Nomad,4,"Maman said there'd be days like this:  Indeed.  I have long wanted to try this bakeshop cum cafe's famed Chocolate Chip Cookie.  Ever since the raves it received back in its early Soho location days.  And what do I do when I finally make it to Maman, which now boasts zillions of NYC outposts like this one?  What do I do?  I get a Nutella Brownie instead.  I don't know what I was thinking. Or maybe I wasn't thinking at all.  At any rate, I wasn't a fan of said Brownie. It hinted of Nutella, which was a good thing, of course.  But it was just too sweet for me, sadly.  I wanted it to be more fudgy too, but then I am a fudgy brownie sort of girl.  The space though, is beyond adorable.  And service on my visit was every bit as sweet as you'd hope for in a place like this.    Bottom line:  Three stars for now, though when I finally get to try that darn Cookie, maybe that will change.  One way or another.",5,10/14/2018,7,4,9,40.7432672,-73.9901338

Maman Nomad,4,"That was the most delicious avocado toast I've ever had.  Everything was so fresh. My only preference would be for them to mix in the sunflower seeds, chili pepper and salt in the avocado spread instead of being put on the side.  Personally, I dont want to be playing chef and figuring out how much salt and chili flakes i should sprinkle on for optimal taste. Just figure it out for me... it is too early.    Hot chocolate was good,  I liked that it wasn't overly sweet.  But it wasn't the best hot chocolate ever.  I didn't even bother finishing it.  After leaving,  I noticed they overcharged me for my orange juice. It is not by a lot, but they shouldn't be charging customers more than the price indicated on the menu.  The place is so cute!

I highly recommend the waffle-iron hashbrowns - smoked salmon, avocado, greens, soft boiled egg on a hashbrown. The lavender latte is the best I've had in NYC.

We always order a macchiato which is a difficult drink to get a good latte art going, but they are able to do it perfectly. I also especially enjoy the serveware they use for the coffee and pastries. They always look like a piece of art.  Admittedly the baristas are not as approachable as what we used to in the village but that's almost the by product of being in the hotel and in the area.

Paper Coffee,4.5,"Came here on a Sunday morning to study with a friend and there were a good amount of empty seats to sit. The place is pretty cute and very aesthetically pleasing! It is located in front of a hotel lobby so it sort of gets distracting and loud with people checking in and out of the hotel.  It was also loud from people who were casually chatting and catching with friends but it didn't bother me too much because I had my earbuds on.  I ordered the Honeybear Latte for $5.99 (including tax). I thought it was okay! It wasn't sweet, which was perfectly fine for me, although I was expecting it to be sweet because of the name. Nothing too special about it but it wasn't bad either.  Staffs are all friendly!  I stayed there from 11AM - 5:30PM. The coffee bar closes at 5, and the menu also includes a few food items as well! I got hungry around 3:30pm and ordered fries and a ""Way to go Burger"" (I think that's what it was called) and both my friend and i devoured it as soon as the server/bartender brought it to us. Food was pretty pricey as it came out to be $34 (including tips) and it was expected because it's located right in a hotel, but my friend and I were both enjoyed the food.  The place did get a bit chilly after an hour or 2 there so bring a extra piece of clothing for warmth!  Overall had a great experience at Paper coffee!

We got cappuccinos, which were delicious, charred avocado toast, granola and yogurt, and an egg sandwich. The avocado toast had so much flavor, the granola and yogurt was as yummy as it was beautiful, and the egg sandwich had house made chorizo sausage that was to die for.

Large, recognizable fresh fruit from berries to plums, a drizzle of honey, homemade granola and Thai basil? In.

Andrew, the barista/bartender extraordinaire, was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in helping us select a coffee creation that suited us. We ended up getting a hot rum americano drink (delicious and pairs well with the sub-zero temperatures outside) and an iced gin espresso drink. Gin and espresso you say? Why yes, THEY GO TOGETHER. Hard to believe but it was one of the most delicious drinks I've had. This coffee shop is located in the lobby of a new hotel called ' 'Made' and it wasn't very busy when we walked in.

The coffee is great and will be served in a glass (if you want it) - the whole vibe is great and atypical of a coffeehouse experience but more of a relaxing vibe.  There isn't much in the way of pastries.

I pulled open the door once I figured out it was the door (it almost looks more like part of the wall) and stepped in with curiosity. Instantly I was enveloped with indescribable wonderfulness. It was a completely unexpected oasis in the middle of the grime,noise and drudgery of the surrounding neighborhood. It reminded me of being somewhere in Europe.  There were a few people sitting around in the lobby of the hotel this is part of (""Made"" yelp.com/biz/made-hotel-?), working on their laptops, and a few people getting coffee. Everything was just nice beyond description in a sort of hard to identify understated way.

As many on here have mentioned, the cold brew was super smooth and easy to drink - it would be especially good on a hot day! The barista also toasted the waffle for several minutes before serving it, which really enhanced the flavor and texture.

Moving on to the coffee itself, I ordered a simple hot coffee as I feel like that's the best way to judge a cafe's product and it was delicious. The flavors were present but not overwhelming, and it was smooth on the palate. I ordered a spinach quiche so accompany it and that was warm and flakey as well. These two items came to a total of just over $10 which seems a little steep to me, even for NYC prices so that's a little off-putting.

PROOF Coffee Roasters,4.5,"This place is so cute! Great work environment - the huge windows let in a ton of natural light, and the shop feels clean and spacious, even if it's not huge. There is a larger table with 3 chairs and a large bench, 2 small tables with 2 chairs each, and 2 table tops with 8 seats. Overall can seat ~20 people comfortably. They play good mood music too, real easy listening.  The barista Jeff is very knowledgeable and passionate about the coffee, eager to share his knowledge of the origins and taste profiles, and generous with the cold brew samples (clearly his favorite!). The coffee is delicious, and they're proud of the fact that they roast their own coffee in-house!  The place is still very new, so there's no menu (but they're working on it) and the decorations are sparse (which isn't a bad thing!). They have a cool membership deal which I would definitely get on board with if I didn't already make my own coffee most days.

PROOF Coffee Roasters,4.5,"Good coffee, cute store with relaxing atmosphere and some pleasant AND unpleasant employees working at the counter. I really liked the atmosphere and had good interaction/experiences with employees several times.  Somehow, the specialty latte I ordered didn't quite turn out the way it's supposed to be and the employees working that day offered to make a new one; I didn't want to cause too much hassle and gratefully declined but he insisted me on coming back again and they'll make a free drink on the house. I asked if he could give me something in writing or a voucher so I didn't have to explain myself if someone else is working, he pleasantly explained to just come in and they'll gladly do it for me, and I believed him as I actually have witnessed a very good customer service in the past.  So I went back on 2/19/18 in the morning and something I didn't expect happened. The employee working that morning was pleasant until I explained what happened and asked for a drink. His whole attitude changed towards me to such a rude and condescending manner, and asked me for a proof (or a voucher). When I explained that I asked for one but wasn't given anything, he snapped at me ""fine!"" in such an annoyance and started to make my drink in silence until I awkwardly walked out of the coffee shop.  I don't know if this man owns the store and thinks that I'm trying to take advantage of this coffee place, but this man really made me feel little and as if I was a beggar, it felt humiliating. I was really glad to see a new quality coffee shop open in the neighborhood and I enjoyed their coffee to a point where I would have gladly pay $6 for a cup of special latte but unfortunately one bad apple has ruined even my past pleasant experiences. I cringe thinking of my experience that day every time I walk by this place to this date.

Menu is limited and there were only a few things in the display case around 8am but what I got was still very good.

Although the prices are higher than the Starbucks if you are not enrolled in their unlimited coffee subscription ($6.25 and $4 for a 20oz latte and americano respectively, b4 tax).  Also, they do not have a menu for coffee beverages displayed at the store. The barista doesn't seem too welcoming and doesn't seem to be very knowledgeable about their unlimited coffee program. In addition, the neighborhood area is kinda ""sketchy,"" and I wouldn't go there at night by myself.

There are so many other photos on here that do this place justice so I haven't added many of my own. There are flowers everywhere but it doesn't feel overbearing.

I saw this place from a Youtuber I follow (shoutout to Ashley B Choi from Ladies Code!) and the interior design of the flowers in the cafe (as well as the drinks themselves) looked so beautiful that we all had to give it a try. And we were definitely blown away by this place!  The interior is literally a cafe within a flower shop. Upon entering, you'll be greeted by so many varieties of flowers and plants, which gave the space such a pretty and calming environment. It really provides a special place to catch up with friends while enjoying beautifully scented lattes and teas.  Speaking of which, we got the following drinks for our hangout: Lavender Latte, Rose Latte, Berry Good Milk Tea, and Berry Matcha Latte (which I didn't get to take as one of my friends had to leave early before we took the photo). I loved each and every one of the drinks! The Lavender Latte was beautiful as you can taste the lavender in the latte, and to the point that it wasn't overpowering. The same goes for each and every one of the drinks as the scents really mixed well with the coffee and milk to provide a delicious latte drink with hints of beautiful floral scents. Not to mention, the latte art is impeccable! I mean look at those flowers adorned with their respective floral parts!

They have oat milk as an option, so that's a great advantage.  My matcha tasted great - creamy but light, not overpowering or watered-down. While the rose latte looked amazing, with real petals on top, we found it to be overwhelmingly sweet. So the drink can feel a bit too sweet, but it's worth the try - especially for that beautiful picture.",5,11/1/2018,0,0,0,40.70544486,-73.99429321
Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"A super cute cafe filled with flours ! I came before an appointment and had a few minutes to sit and enjoy a drink in the morning. The atmosphere was beautiful and the latte was very good, however, I thought the service could have been friendlier. The spot was pretty quiet so they didn't have to worry about a large rush of customers, since it was early in the morning. I can see this place getting pretty busy around midmorning through early afternoon.  They are also a functioning flower shop so one can buy the flowers that are on display !

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"Both a cafe and florist shop, expect a crowd when going to Remi's. Came here with a small group on the weekend and it was packed! Although they do have a decent amount of seating our group of four was out of luck and had to stand. For the price, everyone agreed that the size of their drinks was too small, and flavor wise my chai was just ok. The rose latte seems quite popular here due to the bright red color is has (very instagramable). Unfortunately, they only had one person working the cafe section of the store, so it took forever for us to get our drinks. I honestly think the florist side of this business is better, they had lots of beautiful and unusual flower arrangements as well as high quality and decently priced for Manhattan potted plants. I'd probably come here for the flowers, not the cafe in the future. (FYI this is not a place to come and study or work on a computer.)",5,3/13/2019,0,0,0,40.70544486,-73.99429321
Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"My experience here can be summed up in one word: repulsive.  Waited at the counter and placed an order for 2 lavender lattes, one iced and one warm. We ordered them ""to stay"" because we wanted to enjoy them in the coffee shop.  The place was crowded but we managed to get a seat at a small table for 2. The barista called our name to let us know the drinks were ready. The iced lavender latte was great tasting, great flavor, just the right amount of milk, ice, flavor, espresso. It came in a disposable plastic cup.    The warm lavender latte was served in a ceramic mug and it had someone's lipstick all over it. It was a dirty used mug that had been drank by the previous customer and never had been washed, it had only been refilled with another latte. We complained to the girl who took our order. She didn't apologize and said you'll have to be patient and wait for another latte.  We waited for the second latte, and the 2nd mug looked like it was dirty as well. The saucer had water on it and some other debris and it looked like the saucer and mug had not been cleaned. How could you do something so egregious twice?!  And to the same customer!?  I would NEVER return here. I prefer clean mugs when I drink my coffee or latte.  It appears that when they're busy, they take the used mugs and place them in one sink and the ones that are supposed to be cleaned are in the same sink--and they have a small divider between them. This is apparently something that's confusing for the barista who reaches into the dirty side of the sink and prepares lattes in dirty unwashed mugs.  Please be careful if you plan on checking this place out.",5,2/18/2019,7,2,2,40.70544486,-73.99429321

We tried the Matcha Latte and a drip coffee, which were both well-made. Seating was a little sparse but the tables / chairs are modular so we eventually found seats for everyone.

A woman came in just to take pictures of the beautifully arranged plants and flowers!  I went here to wait for my friend for lunch and drink a latte. Remi was closest to our lunch location and away from the construction down the street.    I ordered a earl grey latte. The latte was ok. The earl grey flavor was not very pronounced. Next time, I will order a La Colombe coffee.  One of the waitresses was explaining the plants to a customer. Some of the locals came in just to pick up coffee or inquire about a plant.

My friend and I both ordered the matcha latte which came with latte art (yay). It had a subtle sweetness which paired so well with the blueberry muffin I also ordered (tasted great as well).  Seating wise there aren't that many but I'm not complaining because it would have taken away the beauty of this place. It honestly feels like you're sitting in a garden.

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"This place really frustrates me because I so desperately want to give them five stars. It should have hit all the marks: the space is bright and beautiful, and doesn't feel overwhelming despite the countless number of plants in the store; there are a good number of seats for the small space along with free wifi; the food and drinks menu looks good with your standard coffee and expresso-based offerings, pastries, and also very interesting teas (yuzu and jujube in particular stood out to me). It is a family-run business and I am a big proponent of these small coffee shops popping up in boring old Midtown.  But the espressos...are not good. I got the flat white and my boyfriend got the cortado. The burnt and acrid taste of the overly extract expresso cut straight through the milk and they were not the smooth drinks I expected at all. That's really frustrating because I can't, in good conscience, overlook it since Pennylane is only a couple of blocks away and pulls a much smoother shot. I really hope this is an issue with the beans / the new machine still needs some flushing out or adjustments for the right water to ground ratio. Probably will be sticking to the teas here until that's corrected. On the bright side, they have oat milk as an dairy alternative and that's an exciting new product I'm hoping more places will start carrying (as far as I know, Irving Farm in Midtown is the only other place that carries it right now).  Nevertheless, I'm pumped to see this place opened in my neighborhood and have my eyes on some of the cute poinsettias for holiday decorating!",5,11/25/2017,6,1,1,40.70544486,-73.99429321

It was this sparkling strawberry rose drink I forgot the name of it, it was a 16oz drink for $6. That's totally not worth my money because the drink wasn't even good. It's so artificial, it's basically sparkling water with a few rosebuds, a slice of strawberry, and some strawberry syrup. I literally could have gone 7/11 and bought a bottle of sparkling strawberry water for $2. I would still go back to try their other drinks but I know for sure I'm not going to order that drink again. Also, don't take their paper straws because they will charge you 25 cents for it. I didn't know so I took one and I think they thought that I was trying to steal a paper straw...

Most florists will ask how much you are looking to spend before they create the bouquet. She did not. the bouquet we created amounted to three ranunculus and three roses with some seeded eucalyptus.  At the most it should have cost 40 dollars.

Sant Ambroeus Coffee Bar at Loews Regency Hotel,4,"We came here in the most time, Christmas Eve, in search of outside seating that was heated, coffee to warm us up, and a bite to eat. Check check check! Entrance set off of Park Ave and attached to a hotel, people watching was pretty prime. They had more outside seating than inside, and each table had a heat lamp on it. Well, not the first table right in front of it, strange.  Yes, it's pricey (~$10 for a slider style sandwich), but it is near Central Park so location location location. Is this a place to bring a date? Only if your site outside. There is just enough privacy to dish out your best game. I would not bring a large group here though, it is quite small.",5,12/29/2018,0,0,0,40.7644723,-73.9691365
Sant Ambroeus Coffee Bar at Loews Regency Hotel,4,"Have you ever eaten something mindlessly only to stop and look at it angrily in disbelief when you realize it actually tastes good? That's how I felt eating their Apricot Cornetto (ie croissant). I don't even really like apricot, but this thing is good.  Not only that, their tiny prosciutto parma sandwiches are the perfect in between meal snack. I'm used to having a prosciutto sandwich that has good meat, but lousy bread, but every piece of this thing was perfect. I could probably eat 3 of them and I'm sad that they don't have this Coffee Bar at the Loews in Los Angeles so I can. If you're looking for a quick but delicious snack on the way to something, head here.  PS.

Sant Ambroeus Coffee Bar at Loews Regency Hotel,4,"Sant Ambreous is a cool little UES spot whose modern styling and beautiful baked goods will draw you right in.  My favorite here is their salmone croissant, a freshly baked light-and-airy seeded crossiant with a generous amount of smoked salmon that's so good, I had it two days in a row!  Pair it with their full-bodied and balanced dark roast for a light, delicious breakfast.  While you're here, try out there amazing flourless chocolate chunk cookies. I normally equate the words 'flourless chocolate' with 'dense', but these cookies were anything but - airy, chewy, chocolatey, scrumptious!  I'd suggest you sit outside if it's a nice day, as the indoor counters are a bit high and the stools a bit low for comfort. That aside, this paninoteca/pasticceria, along with it's friendly staff, makes for a nice way to start your morning.",5,4/29/2018,5,2,5,40.7644723,-73.9691365
Sant Ambroeus Coffee Bar at Loews Regency Hotel,4,"I absolutely loved the iced latte that they served in a wine glass.  Unfortunately they were sold out of their seasonal cheesecake so I settled for a brioche bun.  I also bought two mini cakes and had them later.  The clientele who come here reflect the area.  It was fun people watching.  An elderly woman who was a cross between Joan Didion and Joan Rivers with her huge black cat eyed sunglasses and her vintage Chanel bag oohed and ahhed at the display section as her two friends looked on annoyed impatience.    The service at the front was excellent, but one of the girls in the back making the drinks looked miserable.  Even though it was windy many of the patrons sat outside as there is limited seating inside.  I sat outside and people watched as I drank my excellent iced latte.  When I got up after finishing my drink and pastry another elderly lady with bright red lipstick passed by clenching her cane, but what really stood out was her magnificent fur coat and perfectly coiffed hair.  I gotta hand it to this place-- I was pretty amused watching all sorts of intriguing people walk by.  I hope I'm glamorous as these old ladies when I hit their age.  Haha.

Very good coffee, simple and tasty convenience sandwiches, and a real upgrade on pastries you can get in most other places.

Sant Ambroeus Coffee Bar at Loews Regency Hotel,4,"Recently went into this location and had a terrible time trying to buy some pastries to go. The staff at this particular shop have no clue about customer service, no attentive manners, not even eye contact and let me not start about denying a shopping bag for all the pastries I bought. Usually a fan of the one at Madison and 78th street and after this experience, will definitely stick to that one only.

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,Cute and hip little coffee shop in the basement of a semi-busy street near Times Square. I usually avoid the area around Times Square like the plague but happened to stumble upon this spot one day and had to go inside. It gave off major Williamsburg vibes and wasn't too crowded. Think white and black interior with a cute Instagrammable neon sign and some plants.  Coffee was reasonably priced ($2.75 for a small 8oz) and they didn't charge extra for almond milk. Quality coffee and not bitter at all. I got my coffee to go but there was plenty of seating inside and WiFi. Would definitely come back to do work here.,5,2/24/2019,1,0,0,40.7588772,-73.9902301

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"Just west of Times Square, and right next to the A/C/E train on 44th near 8th Ave, this quaint coffeeshop attracts a clientele of both locals and tourists alike.  With local roasters and various alternative milks (including oat!), it will keep the non-coffee-drinkers and the espresso needs of the hipster totally happy.  Located in the basement of a tenement building, the cafe has a small number of tables and free wifi, and pastries from various local bakeries, including cookies from Ovenly, and donuts from Underwest (only on Wednesdays and Saturdays last time I checked).  Definitely a worthwhile stop for your coffee fix in Hell's Kitchen and, as almost every other coffeeshop in NYC, be sure to pick up a punch card if (and when!) you come often.",5,11/20/2018,14,7,12,40.7588772,-73.9902301

We were the first in, and really got to enjoy the coffee shop for what it was. It's a cute shop on the lower level and has a lot of great coffee and pastry options. I had the pistachio cardamom bread with a flat white, and it was delightful. My cousins were impressed with the s'mores donut (he said it's more of a cake donut, but still delicious), and the fall-inspired latte art on the Mocha.  The two baristas were really kind and made sure we felt comfortable. we enjoyed the music they had on, and overall, the atmosphere of the coffee shop. It's a nice place to sit in the morning if you're early enough to beat the crowds. Typical prices you'd expect for a NYC coffee shop.",5,10/7/2018,0,0,0,40.7588772,-73.9902301

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"Stumbled into St Kilda on a gorgeous, sunny day on Sunday - prior to brunch.  The service was excellent - both baristas were efficient, friendly, and welcoming.  I got the house drip black, but if you want milk, you have your regular dairy choices plus oat milk, soy, and almond.  I think they have rice but don't remember for sure.  The coffee was perfectly temped at a delicate, yet, warming degree, and it was perfection while I waited to get seated.  After brunch, brought some friends along who also got their caffeine fix.  The space is tiny so definitely better for a grab and go, but they have a nice nook outside that has a bench if you want to nestle yourself in while sipping a soothing cup of finely-roasted and crafted caffeinated brew.",5,10/3/2018,1,1,2,40.7588772,-73.9902301

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"I can't stop coming here! Love the location, the shop, the barista, and most importantly the coffee/espresso!!  I love coming here before heading into work, it feel like such a respite from the commotion of 8th Ave. The decor is clean and and low-key, giving it a very nice atmosphere. It's very well lit for being a ""below the street"" place, and I honestly think that adds to it's charm, you get a visual break form the city too. They have a good amount of seating, and I've always been able to snag a seat if I wanted one.  Prices are reasonable, if not a bit lower than the typical NYC cafe. It seems like they have a lot of regulars too, the barista seemed to a lot of people who came in. She was really lovely.  They make such a good latte! The espresso is always perfect, and I don't even add sweetener when I get their latte. The cold brew is also on point, full bodied and not bitter at all. Mmm! They have a good assortment of baked goods too, the chocolate chip cookie has a dash of sea salt which always brings the flavors up a level.

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"Scotland, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand all have areas of land called ""Saint Kilda"" and, honestly, I wish this coffee shop had a similar number of locations because it is siiiiiiick.  I used to live kind of close to this place and I am sad it didn't exist when I did. This is a really beautiful cafe with a crazy selection of treats from places like Ovenly and Underwest Donuts.  The monster star here is the oat milk and the espresso though. They combine to make a drink unlike anything I have ever seen before with these black flecks and deep ochre crema (see pics).

I only got tea, but the tea list is nice with a variety of options, all certified organic. The man working behind the desk was also very warm and welcoming.  Next time I'd like to try some coffee.

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"The general rule in NYC is the further away from Times Square you go, the better the coffee becomes. St. Kilda Coffee is the exception. On 44th St in between 9th and 10th Avenues, it's 1.5 blocks from Times Square (aka the tourist trap). As any good coffee shop should that close to Times Square, it's hidden in the basement of a building and very easy to miss. But don't. It's worth not missing.  It's a small espresso shop with two small tables at the window, four small tables to the right, and a medium sized table to the left when you walk in. The bar is at the back crafting a great cup of espresso or latte. Pastries are served all day and the corn flake blueberry muffin is one of the best muffins in NYC. Just outside the basement are a few black benches to enjoy the outside with your cup of coffee.  Surprisingly, it's a cozy place to work. Most people get their coffee to go so you're bound to find an open table. With plenty of outlets throughout the shop an strong free WIFI ( network name is ""Cafedownunder"" and password is ""findusonyelp"" as of April 30, 2018), it's a great spot to work.  Another thing to note is the barista is friendly. NYC AND coffee shops get a bad rap on friendliness so that says something! A NYC barista nice? AWESOME!",5,4/30/2018,3,2,2,40.7588772,-73.9902301

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"Love the d̩cor!!  By far the prettiest coffee shop in Hells Kitchen.  Simple and modern, bold colors and styles.  Love that's in a basement.  Unfortunately, despite all the style I'm not crazy about the coffee here, well espresso for me that is.  By far my biggest peeve - they won't take my loyalty card and my CUPS app at the same time?!?  Not cool.  :-( You want me to choose? Then you'll lose every time because I love my Cups app and I use it everywhere.  But I'll let you in on a little secret - I never finish my loyalty cards!!! Well, except the coffee shop right downstairs at work because well, everybody's lazy.  So I every year I have to purge my wallet of about 20 loyalty cards with like max 2-3 punches each.  So dammit, why you gotta ruin my fun?  I just like collecting them. :-(  Always seem to snag a table here, so that's nice.  I like the little black wooden spoon they always give me with my espresso.  Oh, and if you're lucky they're brewing the super long Japanese cold brew in the big circular tube drip apparatus.  Oh, and what's up with the decaf espresso?  I wish people would just be honest and say no sometimes but they never do.  Then I'd just order tea or nothing.  I asked and the guy said yes.  You know, the usual nonchalant hipster I don't care type answer.  I asked where because I only saw one grinder and he vaguely gestured somewhere else so I just gave up.  Sorry, I guess decaf ain't cool?  Every coffee shop has regular/skim/almond/soy/etc. milk now but decaf still has a shame thing going on.  Well I started drinking decaf recently for health reasons (none of your damn business thanks) but my hubby still drinks regular.

Simple interior to go along with a straight forward menu. Settled on the regular latte and a cheddar scone (total $8). Latte has the right amount of milk that balanced out the bitter coffee. Not overbearing at all but kept me awake for most of the day. Scone is your regular fare, a little tough on the outside but a soft buttery interior.  This place is adept for people who want to work on their laptops. Outlets all along the walls near the tables.

I almost felt like I was somewhere tropical with the plants dotting the staircase one descends to enter the cafe.  There's room for about 20 people to sit  - individual people and a group were working away. Also, It didn't hurt that the Clash was on....

I was running errands in the area and being the coffee lover/connoisseur that i am, I looked up a new spot to try and settle here. Settle turned out to be the wrong word. I am a creature of habit, so I literally just get the same thing every time. However, it delivers every time. So I say: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I am absolutely obsessed with the picollo as it reminds me of the tristano doppio uptown at Sicaffe. I was so sad when it closed so i'm happy to have found another spot. Anyway, aside from the delicious coffee, the baristas and owner are super sweet and welcoming. Especially after a long night shift, I love coming in here for my morning coffee.

St. Kilda is on the border between the theater district and Hell's Kitchen: it's across the street from Birdland. Though it's at the basement level, it's all glass facing the street. Plenty of light reflected off the white walls.  There are a few tables. Their equipment is top quality. Coffee by Birch--it is excellent. I got a latte, and it was one of those. One of those where I left, had my first sip, and had to return and thank them: it was a God shot. Flawless foam (meaning, not boiling hot). Excellent job combining milk and the shot. No fussy latte art, but you know, I've lost count of the hearts and birds and what not where the coffee drink tasted like utter hell.  Welcome to the neighborhood.

It's a great work space because there are a bunch of outlets with strong WiFi.  My only compliant is it was a hot summer day when I came in, and the only ventilation they had was keeping the front door open. It got a bit stuffy/hot in there, especially since it's a basement location.

You know the kind? Not library quiet but not Starbucks loud. Not deserted and lonely, but not strangers reading your laptop screen. You know, the goldilocks zone. For me, St Kilda's ""is just right.""  This place gets an A+ from me. You can do some serious editing here, and notebook or laptop first drafts. It's not so loud you can't think, and it's not so quiet all you do is think about how you're not writing enough. And, at least while I was there, there was some great people watching, giving you a good chance at some character inspiration.

They have a full coffee menu (any drink can be made iced) but limited baked goods which should be expanded to compete with the better known coffee shops. There is a selection of books if you need something to read as well as T-shirts and small bags for purchase with logos.

Allow me to explain:  The good: the coffees are decent, very friendly baristas, sufficient seating upstairs and a bathroom well taken care of. Fast WiFi, some power outlets upstairs and they don't bother you like other places if you're just working on your computer with a coffee.  Now the scary part--which was completely my fault. I was locked inside!  It's one of those afternoons where you put on your headphones and enjoy the productivity included with your $4 cold brew. I completely lost track of time and was even happy that all of a sudden the place became so empty. Roughly 40min after the closing time....I realized the music stopped and shortly after I heard the glass doors being locked... I packed my things as I would on a super late morning, rushed downstairs and...found myself trapped inside like a desperate lab rat. I tried calling the number of the business but then saw the telephone right in front of me  ... I'm sorry but I had to peek inside the closet where I found a lanyard holding what looked like an access card, and phew!!--they worked at the back door! I kept the doors open and put the card back where I found them. I closed the doors behind. Sorry again!

Taylor St Baristas,4,"DRINKS | I ordered Pearl Jasmine Tea. With it being my first time here, I didn't know what to expect, but if you order ""for here"", it comes with a little tea cup and tea pot so you can manage how much tea you want at a time. If you ask for honey when you order, they provide the honey in a little side cup as well. A+ tea and presentation.  SERVICE | Yes, yes, yes. The barista is so friendly and excited about not only serving orders, but also interacting with the customers and co-workers. From sitting there, I could tell the barista really wanted to make sure everyone was enjoying themselves and that their drinks came out just right.  SPACE & AMBIANCE | I do not think upstairs seating was open because I came in the early morning hours. As for downstair- the space is a little small, but bench seating is available: it can probably fit around 6 people at a time. Ambiance is casual, comfortable, and friendly.

I came in during the work day morning rush and there were several customers both in front and behind me - and kept flowing in. Obviously a very popular place with the working professionals in the area so I would advise to expect a good 5-10 minutes wait after your order to get your coffee fix. I also tried the gluten-free cinnamon sugar donut, which had interesting texture.

Taylor St Baristas,4,"Was walking around town looking for breakfast and Yelp pointed us here. Place is pretty cute. Downstairs is takeaway, upstairs is done in. Being our first time here got a helpful point in the right direction from the downstairs barista.  Upstairs tables are a little cozy, but the mid-morning buzz was nice for breakfast. The service left a lot to be desired though - we were seated upon arriving at the top of the stairs, but after about 10 minutes it seemed the hostess forgot about us. Frantically waved down a waitress, and ordered some avocado bowl and shakshuka. Food was pretty tasty, but when we asked for the check it took another 10 minutes to flag down the waitress.  Would have been four stars if the waitress/hostess paid a little more attention. Good food, subpart service.",5,3/22/2018,1,0,0,40.75147194,-73.9799013
Taylor St Baristas,4,"I wanted to explore the coffee shops in the hood and was following Yelp reviews. The coffee is okay but I've had better. Wouldn't recommend the americano, pick something else, too much water and tasteless. I see that others liked the latte, so maybe I should have picked that one. The place  is small downstairs. Not many seats, more of a takeaway place. And expensive, 4,50 for an americano which wasn't even good. But staff is really nice and it's a nice atmosphere. And the music is awesome! At least they got the music right. Their own vocabulary for coffee becomes confusing when you want to order. Short black, long black, flat white, pic/mac etc. It feels like they want to be hip, but making too much of an effort and in the end are not.",5,3/23/2018,0,0,0,40.75147194,-73.9799013

Taylor St Baristas,4,Coffee and vibe are good but not good for meal. Came here for work lunch and staff told me the menu was not updated and only limited options were available. Ordered a miso poached egg bowl for $12 and got a tiny bowl only appetizer size. My friend got a slow cooked lamb ($18) and waited for like 20min until the food came (truly SLOWLY cooked). I also got a chai latte which was alright. Nothing really appealed to me and it was really unreasonably priced (probably because the huge space they are wasting while paying super high rent in midtown). Won't come back again for lunch. Might still drop by for coffee though.  Upside - the bowl was tasty and the menu looks pretty creative (with a lot of Asian fusion options like Bahn Mi).

I expected a little more, a vegetable or a green or something in the rice.  When looking around other plates looked much more interesting. This seems like a good place to go if you want to sit and relax while you eat as it seemed to take forever to get the server to pay attention, bring check, run credit cards.",5,4/6/2018,0,0,0,40.75147194,-73.9799013

It's a pretty space, and the server was very nice but I was underwhelmed. Service was well-intentioned but sloppy: I ordered a cappuccino, 30 minutes later, I hadn't received it and couldn't track down the server to ask about it. I ended up placing the order again because it hadn't been put in the first time. Took another 20 minutes to get the coffee. Next, even though the music was not loud, the echoing of other guests' conversations made the noise level unsuitable for quiet work or a conversation.

The upstairs seating area is spacious, the tables along the back wall have outlets nearby which was helpful. I loved the wood industrial decor. The music is a bit loud. I would not recommend  hopping on a conference call (I tried, it was hard).  I started with a juice of carrot, apple, ginger which was delicious and had lovely color. The menu had several yummy sounding dishes, but I was intrigued by the curry chicken pot pie. It sounded really different and interesting. The pie itself was small, about the size of a large muffin, perhaps a little dry, but I liked it. The salad that came with it was tossed in a refreshing gingery dressing which was a good compliment to the pie.  I went downstairs a few times, and each time I saw the baristas either singing or dancing!

I really enjoy the set up because this separation prevents disruption of your activity from people walking in and out. It's also very spacious (rare in the city) with tables well spaced throughout the room. The ambience, lighting, music selection and volume were just right.

The poached egg was perfect- the whites were cooked through, but the yolk was still runny. The egg was well salted. The coffee is strong and bold, and for the price, you get a large glass.

The only qualm some people may have (this is why I loved this place) is how small the inside is. There is not much seating and the whole place can maybe house 3 customers at a time.  COFFEE (5/5) These guys know their stuff. The coffee here is very tasty. My personal favorite drink option at Terremoto is the Long Black which is pretty much an Americano with less water so the espresso flavor comes out a lot stronger. They also have many unique lattes that incorporate cool flavors such as lavender, etc.  Terremoto is worth it.

Terremoto Coffee,4.5,"Play that sade (that's sha-day for you babies who don't know the 90s R&B wonder) because this is some smooth silky latte experience I'm undergoing! Of course the whole milk helps. Maybe not my lack of lactose dissolving enzymes but I have a few working models.  The store itself is celebrating 1 year open since January 2016. The cups are black with gold encouragement and thanks. The specialty lattes are fun and have floral or sweet motives. The barista was a nice guy even though the four people in the coffeehouse were blasting their voices over his explanations of everything. There's a little self explanatory sign for espresso drink newbs on things like ""what's a latte?"". And they have matcha but I wasn't gonna get it this time.  I got the space oddity which has rose petal flavoring, I guess just in time for my special valentine.  Definitely come here. If you can snag a table, nice!

Terremoto Coffee,4.5,"Really solid espresso. But the Bien Cuit croissants are over priced - $3 for plain and $4 for chocolate, fruit, etc.  Went at 8:45am on a weekday, wasn't much selection either.  But I'm biaised, I'm a big fan of Ceci Cela.  I like a buttery, light, crispy & flaky croissant.  This one was thick and too heavy and not crispy enough.  Plus the fruit/chocolate/etc. croissants were really small.    But they have CUPS!  Lucky I could look up prices on the app, because they don't list coffee prices anywhere in this place.  New CUPS customers download the app & get $10!!! Use this code: lzx7t  Oh, definitely use the check-in offer from Yelp, you get 20% off - which makes the croissants a lot lot cheaper! ;-)",5,12/7/2016,5,4,5,40.740787,-74.0033715

He even let me have a quick look at the espresso scale they use (Acaia Lunar) when I told him I plan on buying one sometime soon. The coffee was extra fresh, the milk was textured to perfection. I couldn't ask for more. We planned on going again during our short trip, but unfortunately didn't manage to. It's definitely on my 'To do list' the next time I'm visiting.

Terremoto Coffee,4.5,Damn these people know their coffee.  I went in some early AM to buy a bag of beans and was subsequently asked a series of intense coffee interrogation - what methods do you use to make coffee? Aeropress? Pourover? Do you have a burr grinder? Do you hand grind or have a machine?  It was impressive their depth of knowledge. I think I must have passed because I did wind up getting a bag of coffee. It actually wound up becoming one of my favorite brand of beans (Onix)! I also learned  a lot of the baristas are part of a roasting union of sorts? Unrelated but cool.  The coffee itself here is great - you'll definitely appreciate it if you're into just great pourovers or espresso.

Added a bit of cream and some simple syrup for a well balanced summer drink. Second: the cake is just the right amount of moist as per most olive oil caked, with a hint of pumpkin that makes it unique; delicious. Third: huge spread of avocado on the bread. A little tough to eat with all the ingredients, but it all works well together. Could have used more chili flakes.  The price point is high, just like much of the area.

I was told by a tall girl with dyed streaks in her hair that I couldn't sit there since the tables are not ""laptop-friendly"". I questioned this logic, as I would have sat at the table anyways, even if I didn't have my laptop with me since I ordered food. Mind you, I was there for less than an hour; nevertheless, she told me to move. I'm not one to cause a scene, so I moved. A few moments later, a girl with several books sat down to presumably study and get a coffee. She was not told to move. Meanwhile, I sat in the corner, pining for more room to work and eat. I award The Elk 1 star for poor service and extremely flawed logic.  Next time, I'll wait for a table at Merriweather to open up, and I won't bother coming back again out of principle.

When two oatmeals came out by mistake, they quickly corrected and whipped up an egg wrap in no time.

The music they play in my experience has ranged from a thoughtful selection of Renaissance music to Shen Yun's wonderful music. It makes for a peaceful ambience and a refined aesthetic.  Their coffee, tea, and bites to eat may be on the pricier side for some, but I can always rest assured knowing that it is good if not great quality. Honestly, their coffee is the best I have come across over the course of the years. Don't be shy if they make any mistakes or an issue comes up with your order--they will actually take the time to make things right if you speak up and explain what happened. They are a kind bunch!

You will notice many Chinese books on the wall, all the way towards the back. Come to find out this is first a bookstore/meditation place and then a coffee shop.  The coffee shop is owned by a non-profit organization. Their main focus is the book store and mediation sessions they have towards the back of the shop.  If you pass by in the mornings you will see a very nice guy by the name of Tony. He is whom I approached and asked him about the cafe. Take the time to talk to him, very down to earth chill guy.  Now about their coffee! It's great thus far. I've tried their tiramisu cafe latte and their pistachio cafe latte which both have been very nice. I've gone with those two options because for the time being they didn't have caramel which is my go to.  They have a great assortment of pastries. I have tried so far only the maple walnut danish. Very Yammy! Now I do want to try their homemade Tiramisu. Apparently it's prepared by their chef who is a young man from France .  Their cups are really nice, no handles.

Though the drinks are quite expensive (over $5 for an iced latte) I'm used to paying that much for my coffee / anything away from the over-crowded street made me happy.  One thing I will complain about though is how cold the store is. I was wearing my very warm winter parka inside the store yet the tip of my nose and fingers were freezing up. This made me have to go get a warm tea, which I also paid close to $5 for, but the Tea Forte tea bags that they sell were SO cute! With their little green leaf sticking out of the cup, I just had to have it. The cold made my tea get colder quicker, but I still enjoyed it while it was warm. The wifi is also only 30 min free, so if you're trying to find a place to get work done for a long period of time, you may have to pay (I think it was around $2-3 for an hour).

Tianti Books,4,"I don't know Tianti Books before it moved to this new location on 8th Ave.  I thought it was a new business, so I went to check out this out today because I'm in the area a lot.  I was kind of excited about the place.  I thought...new small business. Hey, let me go support it.  I get there and everything is super expensive, but I said to myself, let me just try it. I got a medium regular coffee. It was smooth, but I didn't think it was worth the price.  I also got a pastry, which was OK, but it was overpriced as well. The bill came out to be $11.32 for a pastry, a medium house coffee, and 15% tip.  I am not a rich guy, but I sucked it up and ended up getting it because I believe in supporting small businesses.    I asked about Internet access.  The internet is ""free"" for the first 15mins. After that, you have to pay.  At this point, I wanted to leave, but I tried to justify all the prices because hey, it's Manhattan, and the rent here is skyrocketing.  I was there for about 20 minutes, just me working in the corner.  The place was empty.  Then I started to cough uncontrollably (I was just getting over a cold). I couldn't stop coughing no matter how much I tried to control it. I went to the counter to ask for water. They could clearly see me coughing in front of them. I was about to pop my eyes and lungs out on to the counter. Tap water. That's all I wanted. No, not just wanted. I needed that water. I've already spent $11.32 on a coffee and a pastry. And you'd think they'd give it to me after already spending that much. No.  ""Actually, that'll be $.35, sir.""    ...  To be fair, they came up to me after I stopped coughing and apologized. As much as I wanted to, I couldn't leave right away because I was in the middle of something on my computer.  I drank whatever coffee was left in my cup to stop the coughing, and finished my work.  They offered some water after the fact, and I refused because I was so angry.  As a former server myself, I would've left that water anyway just in case.  But what happened?  They bussed my table, and...took the water away.  All I know is that I will never come back to this place.  I am usually very happy to support small businesses, and I intend to keep supporting small businesses, even though I don't make that much money myself, but this place is making it very hard for me to keep doing so.",5,10/12/2016,6,1,1,40.753943,-73.992609

My only complaint is that they are slightly more expensive than some places and they are not open very late. But really I don't mind paying a bit more for the awesome setting and environment.

UT47,4.5,The interior is cute and it has WiFi (only for 2hrs) and outlets but wow the matcha latte I got was the shittiest matcha latte I have ever had in my entire life. It's like drinking warm sand. I don't even understand how they did it. I got thirstier as I was drinking but I couldn't continue - good thing I brought a water bottle with me to wash it off. What a pity because the space is actually pretty nice.,5,4/4/2018,0,0,0,40.76131282,-73.98997486
UT47,4.5,"Walked a ways to get here on the premise there were macarons, great scones, and teas. The place itself is really narrow upon entrance, but has a much more open space toward the back, to the right. Unfortunately this was a coffee run on behalf of my team so there was no time to sit and enjoy the ambiance. The place is nicely decorated, very zen.  I asked the barista her favorite drink and was recommended the Taro Root Bubble Tea. It was unfortunately underwhelming. The drink itself is alright - doesn't taste special at all. $5.25 for a 16 oz cup of what tasted like taro powder and milk. The tapioca was really... really not good. I'm sorry. I would highly advise against having it in your drink. I suppose it's my fault coming to a coffee shop and trying bubble tea.  We also tried to order the macarons, looks like they come from macaron caf̩, but they did not have any. We purchased some scones in their place that I tried, not bad. My coworker said the brownie was really good, though I did not try. Overall, was a miss with the items I ordered today. I would consider coming back to try an espresso drink.",5,8/30/2018,1,0,0,40.76131282,-73.98997486

UT47,4.5,My friends and I stopped in here to be able to sit and talk in a nice spot. I ordered an iced coffee and added the lavender flavor and we sat in the small patio they have out back since it was so nice out. It was a great space and the coffee was really good! The outside patio is nicely decorated and almost makes you forget that you're in NYC. I'd recommend stopping here whether you're looking for a good coffee to go or a place to waste some time with friends.

UT47,4.5,"Just mediocre as far as we experienced and not worth the cost. Coffee is decent and the bagel sandwiches we had are not anything special. Baked goods were alright, but I was impressed that they have some vegan items. Service was excellent and atmosphere was nice too. Nice side-street location, which is off of the busy 9th Ave corridor.

UT47,4.5,"First time here. They advertise free WiFi but it doesn't work. Their WiFi password mentions their bubble tea which is now available. Ordered the taro and it tastes like chalk mixed with water, would not recommend here if bubble tea is what you're looking for.  The atmosphere seems nice and mellow, but would not come again.",5,5/12/2018,2,1,1,40.76131282,-73.98997486
UT47,4.5,"This cafe has been my go-to for settling in and doing work for a couple of weeks. The entire staff is very friendly and the kale spinach croissant is my favorite pastry to get. They have really fast free wi-fi, an ample number of outlets, and the environment is very comfortable. My only issue is that the wi-fi password changes every 3 hours. I understand that's how you ensure that people actually purchase something since the password is on the receipts, but it feels a little excessive and interrupts my work. One of the reasons I started going to this cafe is that it closes later than any other one I've found, but that extra time doesn't matter if I spend a half hour inputting the new password is then waiting for staff to figure out why it doesn't work, which is what I did yesterday. I should also add that it's not the quietest cafe, so not the best place to work if you need silence.",5,5/27/2018,1,1,1,40.76131282,-73.98997486

HOWEVER, I ordered a taro bubble tea today, and I was IN SHOCK that the young lady who made my drink used her BARE HAND to grab the bubbles from a small container and put them in the glass. NO gloves. NO spoons. Seconds ago, she just touched the cash register. I will go back since this place has everything I need to spend couple of hours.

UT47,4.5,"Wow- what a hidden gem in the heart of Hell's Kitchen. The first thing I noticed was the design- everything's super modern, clean and minimal--very pleasing to the eye. The lighting is perfect for reading or working on your laptop, which I noticed many of the patrons were doing. The noise level was great; music was kept to a soothing volume. The outdoor patio (hard to find in any cafe in this area!) was SO cute, guys. Coffee was ok, nothing amazing but not bad. I had a cheese danish and again also just ok. Hence the minus 1 star. HOWEVER their donuts are a must try- the maple waffle is divine. So I'm coming back for how comfortable everything looks, the donuts, and the people who work there- the staff people were the BEST- so friendly and happy. Great conversation with the head lady there who I believe might be the owner? They all work so hard and are clearly good people. Nice job UT 47!",5,8/8/2018,1,0,0,40.76131282,-73.98997486

The bonus is that there's an outdoor patio in the back, that is very inviting and comfortable.  The music is good and soothing/hip... which helps beat out the occasional car traffic honking. They deserve the 5-stars though, so I didn't subtract for that.  Randomly, they also have halva donuts, which I haven't seen too many of in the NYC area... not sure how they are bc I can't afford the calories lol",5,7/1/2018,1,1,1,40.76131282,-73.98997486

So this is a good place to enjoy your coffee and complete some work at the same time. The wifi is good and the password is shown on the receipt.

UT47,4.5,"I generally like this neighborhood cafe because they are nice, a bit pricey but totally worth it for a variety of choices and mainly because its a great place to get work done in peace. However, I was recently disappointed to see that they are trying to subtly change their hospitality policies - last time I sat with a friend for a pot of tea they came when we hadn't even finished it to ask if we were ordering something else (pot of tea is $10), and now I saw that they deliberately covered up all the plugs so you can't charge devices. While it's fine if they didn't want to provide that, they originally had signs outside calling in customers for their free wifi and now they seem to be regretting it. It would even be better if they charge customers for using outlets rather than cover them up out of the blue... There are still great things about this cafe but I am disappointed to feel these passive aggressive nudges.",5,2/24/2019,0,0,0,40.76131282,-73.98997486
